0,The Capital Grille,"This is a 5 star, vegetarian-friendly, fine-dining place specialized in American food, seafood and steak which also serves alcohol and has a good wine menu."
1,The Capital Grille,I will definitely come back. The food overall was amazing. We got the Mac and Cheese which was Phenomenal!!!! I think I got the NY Strip steak but it was BOMB! Also I got like a cucumber vodka lemonade which was great. Everything was a surprise and I loved it. They made my day so special
2,The Capital Grille,"This is a fantastic restaurant.  Dined there Sunday, September 13th for my son's 17th birthday.  Connie was a great server, knowledgable and non-judgmental when we did not order alcohol (unlike many other high end steakhouses, where the servers push alcohol to increase their tip!).  All five steaks we ordered were perfectly prepared/correct temperature/excellent quality meat, the lobster tail on surf and turf was outstanding (and fresh).  Social distance seating was excellent, actually made for a much less hectic experience than most steak places.  If you want a really nice evening/meal for you and your family when you are in downtown Chicago, EAT HERE!  You will love it!"
3,The Capital Grille,"Atmosphere is so elegant and romantic. Best steals and freshest seafood. If you love seafood,  you should try the cold seafood tower. It is $110, but truly enough to feed two people. The first time we went,  we filled up on this appetizer and didn't even order dinner.  Top notch!!!"
4,The Capital Grille,I took my girlfriend to The Capital Grille and it was one of the most wonderful dining experiences we've ever had!!! The food was magnificent. Our server was tremendous and he went out of his way to make sure that our date night was nothing less than perfect! Would recommend The Capital Grille to anyone!!!!! Top notch fine dining at its best!
5,The Capital Grille,Good spot for tasty Quality Meals. Staff is always nice even when they have a full house. The service was very welcoming and observant. Bring your hunger - portions are generous. Food is like a restaurant in Jacksonville I loved.
6,The Capital Grille,"I thought that the restaurant setting was beautiful and inviting. The management and wait staff could not have been more accommodating,and the service was outstanding. I would definitely go again,the food,service and ambience were impeccable.if you are looking for a fine dining experience with good service and a very good meal and drinks I highly would recommend Capital Grille."
7,The Capital Grille,"My wife and I came here to celebrate our first anniversary and we couldn't have asked for a better experience. Food was phenomenal! Pictures don't do it justice. Staff was so accommodating and went above and beyond, especially our waiter Diego. A memory to cherish for a lifetime!"
8,The Capital Grille,"I visited the Capital Grille for lunch with friends, and was impressed by how personal the service was. I chose a ahi tuna steak as my entree, which was a mistake- I found that I do not enjoy tuna, but my mom thought it was excellent. Besides this, the restaurant is conveniently located near many shopping destinations, and I was very happy with the experience I had here."
9,The Capital Grille,"The food was excellent!! My favorite was the lobster mac and cheese. But beware of specials/prices waiter suggested special which husband, and I ordered. However, we never asked price of dish... It was $65 per dish!! To me it was malicious the way it happened because special was highest thing on meal and price was never mentioned. But besides that mishap everything was great!!"
10,The Capital Grille,"We ordered the lobster and crab cake for the appetizer. It was delicious. Main entrees included New York strip (medium), lobster mac and cheese. All were great. My fiance had the maple seared salmon and it also was decadent. Our server was great and made sure we had room for the complimentary desert."
11,The Capital Grille,"Nice location for delicious Quality Meals. Got there near five, it wasn't very busy. There was fast, efficient, and courteous service. Bring your appetite because portions are large."

14,The Capital Grille,quality meals at this spot - super tasty. Came in on a Weds. The service here is great. This place has a great design. Feels like a place in Los Angeles I loved.

19,The Capital Grille,"Good spot for tasty Quality Meals. Staff is always nice even when they have a full house. The service was very welcoming and observant. Bring your hunger - portions are generous. Food is like a restaurant in Jacksonville I loved.   I wanted to jump up and down with excitement after my first bite! My fianc√© even said at the end of our dinner ‚Äúthis was the best restaurant in my entire life‚Äù mind you, she traveled around the world and tried many foods! I suggest you share a for the table dish (serves two). Totally would go back for sure!"
20,The Capital Grille,A fav location for quality meals. It was so savory. The staff was very welcoming and sociable. It has an awesome atmosphere. I can see why they have so many good reviews.
21,The Capital Grille,"Good, delicious food that serves food with history and smiles. I just love this place, its menu and its owners."
22,The Capital Grille,Quality Meals and the scene here is great. super savory. i look forward to a return trip. the bill was fair for the quality of food.
23,The Capital Grille,Stopped by for lunch while walking the Mile. The server recommended the calamari and it didn't disappoint. The atmosphere seems like a place my parents (or grandparents) would have enjoyed but the food and service was great.
24,The Capital Grille,Went there for my husband's birthday.  The service was excellent! The waitor was fabulous. The food is always good and the birthday dessert was superb. Even the manager came over and Woodhead my husband a happy birthday.
25,The Capital Grille,"Came here this past weekend to celebrate my husbands birthday. DIEGO and the capital grille team went ABOVE AND BEYOND and did an amazing job when it came to customer service, being flexible about us being late (due to traffic) Diego was so attentive and very well detailed. He was super friendly and just had an amazing attitude all night. He also gave us a COMPLIMENTARY dessert for my hubbys birthday which was super sweet too. The food was amazing as well, we will def be returning for DIEGO!! Thank you  for making his bday so special :)"
26,The Capital Grille,Great place for quality meals. staff is always nice even when they have a full house. prices are appropriate for the quality. menu is like a cafe in boston i loved.
27,The Capital Grille,Quality Meals and the scene at this spot is excellent. i will probably become a regular. it has a great feel to it.
28,The Capital Grille,"quality meals at this spot - great. Arrived at seven, it wasn't crowded. Prices are appropriate."
29,The Capital Grille,"We actually sort of stumbled into this place, early one early Saturday evening, just looking for a place to have ‚Äúa great dessert‚Äú. What a wonderful surprise we had! The service here is tremendous and befits a restaurant with the ‚Äúfine dining‚Äú moniker. Out of curiosity, we did order a couple of appetizers; we absolutely love them! They were rather larger in size than we had anticipated and seasoned exquisitely. The coconut cream pie dessert was as outstanding as had been promised. While we hadn‚Äôt thought about it until this ‚Äúfind‚Äù, this restaurant will probably make the list for our anniversary celebration."
30,The Capital Grille,One of my favorite locations for tasty Quality Meals. it's so tasty. service treated us so nice.
31,The Capital Grille,First class service and food! South African Lobster is the best around!
32,The Capital Grille,"Quality Meals, super yummy. I look forward to a return trip. The bill was fair for the quality of food. Menu is similar to a restaurant in El Paso I loved."
33,The Capital Grille,quality meals and the setting at this place is excellent. it's so appetizing. the service was very kind and attentive. it has a good feel to it.
34,The Capital Grille,Don't pass this place up. We celebrated our wedding anniversary here and were treated like royalty.  The food was amazing and the staff was even better.  We will definitely be back.
35,The Capital Grille,One of my top places for tasty quality meals. Staff is always nice even when they have a full house. The service was very friendly and kind. Prices that are reasonable.
36,The Capital Grille,Great food. The lamb chops were fantastic! Ralph provided excellent service!
37,The Capital Grille,The ambience was nice. The lamb chops & lobster Mac & cheese was very flavorful. They even wrote my hunny bun a little birthday note with a complimentary cheesecake which was nice. 4 stars bcuz our waiter didn‚Äôt come check on us as much as he should have. We had to look for him. & spending $200+ the service shud be above & beyond. But other than that I would recommend.
38,The Capital Grille,Don't pass this place up. We celebrated our wedding anniversary here and were treated like royalty.  The food was amazing and the staff was even better.  We will definitely be back.
39,The Capital Grille,"We made a last minute reservation to celebrate our daughter's success in the city's debate tournament and had a great experience.  Our waitress, Angie, was terrific.  She made our daughter feel very special and even brought out a surprise congratulations dessert.  Angie also mailed us a personalized thank you note and that gesture is what prompted me to write the review.  Taking the time to hand write and mail a note in this day and age went a long way.  Thank you Angie!"
40,The Capital Grille,"I was in Chicago on business, and this place was recommended by a few people. I got the Calamari to start which was outstanding. Clam chowder for soup. (It could have used some clams.) The scallops are terrific. This is a classy place with a simple yet delightful menu."
41,The Capital Grille,"Phenomenal food, decoration, atmosphere and service. This is the perfect place to celebrate an important day."
42,The Capital Grille,"This is my second time to Capital Grille. My first try was in the Boston branch, I had a great experience there, so I booked this time again for my girlfriend‚Äôs birthday. The quality stands the same level even though I haven‚Äôt been here for a while and it‚Äôs a different branch. Highly recommend to order chef‚Äôs suggestion on the menu. Though many people claim a fine steak should be simply tasted with salt & pepper, the seasoning on these steaks of chef‚Äôs suggestions do enhance the taste to a higher level."
43,The Capital Grille,Very good food. The staff was very friendly. I would recommend them to friends and family.
44,The Capital Grille,Excellent example of a service oriented restaurant. The food quality is evident from the first bite. I had the dry aged kona. Cooked perfectly and sides weren‚Äôt an after thought. Yes a good steak is expensive! Please congratulate the staff and chief!
45,The Capital Grille,"Food was excellent, staff was very attentive/friendly, and they have an excellent selection of liquor.  Will without a doubt visit again.  Thank you everyone"
46,The Capital Grille,"Absolutely delicious! Rich was an amazing server. It was our first visit (because of a friends recommendation) and it did not disappoint. We were offered a free taster before our meal and a small dessert to share after. The Kona rubbed steaks and jumbo lump crab cocktail were so good. We will definitely be back. This is a great place to bring family or friends, since it is a little more on the casual side."
47,The Capital Grille,"Great ambiance, fantastic food, and unbelievable cocktails! Thank you so much to our server Anna who was GREAT!!"
48,The Capital Grille,My top spot for tasty quality meals. I look forward to going back again. The bill was fair for the quality of the food.
49,The Capital Grille,"Came here for my 13 year anniversary with my beautiful wife and could not have been any happier with the service and great food. As soon as I walked into Capital Grille we were congratulated on our special day and seated in a booth that was decorated with confetti hearts and had a lovely anniversary card. Ralph & Carlos took care of us tonight and these guys are the best, we need a 6 star rating for them as they went above and beyond to make our night special.  Kudos to the entire staff and chefs which cooked an outstanding meal, we will be back very soon my friends."
50,The Capital Grille,The atmosphere is nice.  Plenty of open space and well lit.  The menu is great.  My lamb chops were amazing. My French Martini was outstanding.
51,The Capital Grille,Absolutely delicious! Rich was an amazing server. It was our first visit (because of a friends recommendation) and it did not disappoint.
52,The Capital Grille,Amazing evening and outstanding service  the meal was like none other.  Everything cooked up perfection.
53,The Capital Grille,"Fine dining in downtown Chicago. The Capital Grille upholds a reputation for superior service and quality food in a fine dining experience. The location is perfectly located just a short block down from The Magnificent Mile area of downtown Chicago and within walking distance of many hotels. The entrance is well marked. We were greeted with hosts and the manager and quickly whisked to our table overlooking the busy city evening. The table service was well orchestrated and highly professional. The drink and wine offerings were varied and interesting. The dinner menu was mouthwatering with a mix of familiar and interesting twists. The White Cheddar Potatoes and Leek Soup was rich and satisfying. The Field Greens, Butter Leaf Lettuce, Heirloom Tomatoes salad was fresh and well displayed. The Gorgonzola Crusted Dry Aged Bone-In NY Strip was perfectly cooked with a decadent crust and a rich cherry cabernet reduction. The Surf and Turf special included a perfectly cooked lobster tail and tender sirloin. The Au Gratin Potatoes side was incredibly rich and cheesy. The prices are high but appropriate; overall, I rate this restaurant as a good value for fine dining, perfect for a business dinner or special occasion. Recommended."
54,The Capital Grille,"One of my preferred places for tasty Quality Meals. Entered near nine, it wasn't busy."
55,The Capital Grille,We had a fantastic thanksgiving meal ‚Äî traditional turkey and fixings ‚Äî all was great and we left stuffed. It came on a plate to the table ‚Äî no buffet! You could also order from the regular menu. They had great wine as well. I think this was just because of thanksgiving because people lingered from what they said... but we weren‚Äôt seated until half an hour past our reservation time ‚Äî so with arriving early we waited over forty minutes. The bar was packed but about half that time we were able to sit down. The staff was all wonderful and took care of us well... so while normally that would be a poor rating I can‚Äôt downgrade their rating. If you go on Thanksgiving you might want to reserve on the early side or go earlier in the day before they back up... or just know it may be a slower experience... but I would definitely go there again for Thanksgiving if we where are in town again for Thanksgiving!
56,The Capital Grille,Nice location for quality meals. the prices are well within reason for the quality. feels similar to a restaurant in philadelphia that i enjoyed visiting.
57,The Capital Grille,I went here to celebrate my birthday. My steak was tender & juicy. The customer service was superb! My waiter Kelly was on point with the service and very knowledgeable. At the end of the dinner she brought me a birthday dessert and two glasses of champagne for me and my boyfriend. I would definitely go back again.
58,The Capital Grille,"Wonderful chain steak house with consistent quality of food and service. The burgers are lunch specialities (3 courses with rotating seasonal menu), good steaks at good prices, and amazing desserts. Try the pineapple cocktail! Valet parking or metered street parking, credit accepted, reservation recommended. Update: the kobe burger are ok, the truffle fries are the star, service is wonderful and prompt"
59,The Capital Grille,"Overall, I had a good experience. The filet and lobster tail from the Chef‚Äôs Selection menu was perfect. Also had the shrimp crostini, nicely done. Service was good, but I expected more. Several times our drinks ran empty and we felt neglected; part of this may have been due to the fact that we were seated in the only table that was basically a part of the bar area. We‚Äôd never been here before and were seated with a reservation but next time I‚Äôd request the main dining area."
60,The Capital Grille,"Quality Meals, mmm, my favorite treat. Got there near five, it wasn't very busy."
61,The Capital Grille,Only had curbside pickup. The crispy chicken sandwich was great. The lobster bisque was great. The lobster macaroni could have been creamier and cheesier.
62,The Capital Grille,Amazing food incredible service. Pricey but worth it plates are big just a great place
63,The Capital Grille,I love their ribeye steak and the french onion soup. The creme brulee is fantastic.
64,The Capital Grille,Went for restaurant week. Food was decent. Stemware for wine was very lackluster -- wish they had used crystal. Salad was average. Steaks were good. Green beans were mediocre. Mashed potatoes were good. Desserts seemed like they just popped out of the fridge - perhaps some powdered sugar would make it look a little more appealing to eat.
65,The Capital Grille,Great food and service...very attentive without being stuffy..delicious steaks and seafood...wonderful wine with the generous poor..
66,The Capital Grille,"Attentive and friendly staff, wonderful service, and delicious food."
67,The Capital Grille,"One of the best! I love coffee. They have a Kona rub. That plus a perfectly cooked steak makes this a great night out for any occasion.  Great staff working in coordination to make sure you have what you need, plus the little personal touches. Among my top 1 or 2 places to eat."
68,The Capital Grille,We love Capital Grille and this one meets or exceeds the high standard. Service was incredible. Up there with the best service we have experienced. The drinks were excellent as was the food. The butternut Squash soup was incredible. The Lamb Chops equally great as were the steaks the rest of our group had. All cooked perfectly as requested. 5 stars all around.
69,The Capital Grille,"OMG has such a lovely time, Diego was such a gem, best customer service hands down. The surf and turf was delish. A must go."
70,The Capital Grille,Really nice restaurant if you want to eat some excellent meats.
71,The Capital Grille,Nice food. Friendly service. Comfortable dining environment.
72,The Capital Grille,"Delicious food, beautiful atmosphere. For the amount of money I payed for 1 meal, you'd think I'd get a huge plate. No. I got a dinky little steak and the smallest lobster tail ever for $56. I ordered a side of mashed potatoes for $11. Still left hungry after spending $74 on just myself."
73,The Capital Grille,I always look forward to dining at Capital Grille! My favorite selections are the Steak Tartare and the Lamb Chops. All the sides are delicious and large enough to share.
74,The Capital Grille,"Went for breakfast and really enjoyed this place. It was locally sourced right down to the wood from the tables.Food was generally delicious and you could tell it was super fresh.There can be long waits, especially on weekends. This has to be interpreted as a reflection of how good this place is."
75,The Capital Grille,"Came for Restaurant Week and two birthdays, definitely did not leave disappointed. Despite going with their heavily discounted RW menu and being very busy, we were still surprised to find they still went all out to make the birthday girls special, from a complimentary champagne toast to a beautiful Happy Birthday desert. And the portion sizes were great too, and everyone left fat and happy, even with some leftovers. Thank you to Diego our server for making it a great night!"
76,The Capital Grille,"I ate here with a large group for a sponsored event. Our group of ~20 was comfortably seated in a private room with 4-5 dedicated servers. It was a fixed course meal but absolutely delicious. Will come back again on my own for the food, drink, and service."
77,The Capital Grille,"I live nearby and have walked by for several years, but tonight was the first time I ever ate there. Excellent all around. Excellent steak, cocktail, bread, sides, service, with a great atmosphere. Not snooty, not uppity, not casual but relaxing and friendly vibe. I will definitely go back!"
78,The Capital Grille,5 star steaks in my opinion!!
79,The Capital Grille,"This a classic old school steakhouse that doesn't disappoint. The food was up to par. We had a medium rare filet, salmon, mashed potatoes, green beans and creme brulee.  All of our selections were perfectly cooked and properly seasoned."
80,The Capital Grille,"I was particularly impressed with the service of John David and Mario. They exuded the spirit of hospitality an professionalism. Despite the fact that The Capital Grille is a chain, it is consistently excellent. Go there and say hi to the gentlemen, John David and Mario!"
81,The Capital Grille,Don't pass up the bone in ribeye. Great meal and excellent service.
82,The Capital Grille,Rich was our waiter and he was very attentive and friendly. The food was amazing. The staff was nice. Great experience all around!
83,The Capital Grille,Food was just OK.  I had the special which was the steak salad.  It was OK.  The balsamic dressing weighed the salad down and I found myself feeling full quickly.  Decor on the walls need a good dusting.  The taxidermy buffalo was especially dusty.  Wait staff was very nice.
84,The Capital Grille,"We had the most wonderful experience at CG. It was our anniversary and they treated us like royalty. Our Server, Rich, was attentive, helpful and engaging. We were given complimentary champagne, and an appetizer along with a very yummy dessert. The best part was when we went back later to get their butternut squash soup as a carry out as my husband was sick . They were compassionate and treated us like family.  Can‚Äôt say enough about the heart of the people who run this place. Just go there!"
85,The Capital Grille,"Good choices for appetizers and desserts. Steak was delicious. Cooked to perfection. Price reasonable for quality of food. If you are in the area and looking for great steak, check this place out."
86,The Capital Grille,"Classy place, great service and also the food"
87,The Capital Grille,"Good steaks, great wine list, the service I received at the bar was personable and lovely. The bone in ribeye was perfectly cooked. The truffle fries were a disappointment but the wine list kinda made up for it."
88,The Capital Grille,"A beautiful and classy Steakhouse, their signature balsamic rub on the steak is to die for, like all client focused business their dedication and touch of personized dessert is sweet enough for anyone. 5 stars"
89,The Capital Grille,"Spent a wonderful evening at The Capital Grille in downtown Chicago with my wife and two carnivorous sons. We enjoy fine dining and this was our first trip to Capital Grille. We arrived early for our reservation and took a seat at the bar. I channeled my inner Don Draper and ordered an Old Fashioned. The cocktail was mixed perfectly, nicely balanced and attractively garnished. The bar staff was attentive and prompt. The d√©cor is a more modern take on a typical steak house. While there was a nice buzz from the dining room the tables were spaced far enough apart to easily move through the space and feel you could converse freely without having to shout over other guests to be heard. The kitchen offered an amuse bouche which was nicely presented. The wine list is extensive with a great selection of both new and old world varietals. Wine by the glass is also available. Bread service was prompt and offered a nice selection which tasted freshly prepared.   We come here with friends always when we feel like eating something gorgeous!"
90,The Capital Grille,I visited here on a Sunday and they had a weekend happy hour which was nice and unexpected. I had a few of the happy hour appetizers and they were fantastic. They also have a solid beer and wine list. Great little place for drinks and appetizers..
91,The Capital Grille,Excellent example of a service oriented restaurant. The food quality is evident from the first bite. I had the dry aged kona. Cooked perfectly and sides weren‚Äôt an after thought. Yes a good steak is expensive! Please congratulate the staff and chief!
92,The Capital Grille,"This place never fails on service, presentation or taste.  An excellent choice for the holiday and non-traditional fare."
93,The Capital Grille,Birthday dinner was perfect. They gave us free dessert (cheesecake and brownie with fruits) that said happy birthday on the plate. We reserved with OpenTable which had the option for choosing for which occasion; we obviously chose Birthday. We ordered the daily special's porterhouse steak and regretted ordering medium rare because it was a bit more bloody than we'd liked but that's our fault. Delicious.
94,The Capital Grille,Went to the bar here for a nightcap. They make a great chocolate martini.  Met some great people. Very nice dark wood and brass old feel.
95,The Capital Grille,"One of the best! I love coffee. They have a Kona rub. That plus a perfectly cooked steak makes this a great night out for any occasion.  Great staff working in coordination to make sure you have what you need, plus the little personal touches. Among my top 1 or 2 places to eat."
96,The Capital Grille,"Wow, a wonderful upscale place with exceptional quality meats, great atmosphere and service"
97,The Capital Grille,We received a gift card and visited capital Grille over Christmas. What a nice dining experience!  Very pleased with everything. The fare and service was exceptional.
98,The Capital Grille,Our server Rich was fantastic! Very friendly and attentive üôÇ
99,The Capital Grille,Exceptional steak and great ambience! Two things I need to complain are: I had waited too long (15mins??) for the waiter to take my order.And I felt like the waiter put pressure on my to tip him much.
100,The Capital Grille,Wonderful! Food was fresh & so good...we shared many of the sides. There were 8 of us & everyone loved their food & service was good too! Definitely a go-to if you're in Chicago!
101,The Capital Grille,The setting was stunning. Our wait staff was superb. We chose to order 1 wine pairing between the two of us and thank goodness that we did.
102,The Signature Room,"This is a 5 star, kid-friendly, fine-dining place that serves American food and has an amazing view of the city."
103,The Signature Room,Website does not mention anywhere that they are closed.
104,The Signature Room,Awesome views and the most amazing brunch ever. Located on the 95th floor of the John Hancock Tower in downtown Chicago. Located right on Michigan Ave. Why pay for the observation deck when you can pay slightly more and get the same view with the most spectacular brunch you'll ever have. Great Bloody Mary's and Mimosa's as well.
105,The Signature Room,This‚Äôs a great place Or any occasion.  Beautiful and great Service at all Times. Dr. Earnestine Clayton
106,The Signature Room,Fantastic view! Good service and nice drinks. Bit of a tourist-trap though. Still worth a visit for the view alone
107,The Signature Room,"This is a MUST visit, plan ahead and dont be disappointed, this place books out quickly and tables at the windows are highly prize'd and for a good reason, the views are amazing,
Casual dress code.
Hancock Center
At around 1000ft high, the views i believe can take in 4 states,
The building makes tall building look small, this i the perfect place to have a beer."
108,The Signature Room,Have taken many out of towners here for the full touristy experience. Even spend some time celebrating birthdays and engagements here. For the first time I came here with my husband just because and I have to say this is the first time I've really appreciated it. The well known secret is that the bathrooms have the best views.
109,The Signature Room,"Even so we were able to get a table with a great view and and an even better waiter Evan. It can seem a bit stuffy when you are young but when you're an old timer like me just wanting to get away from the kids for a night, you appreciate the dimly lit rooms, quiet music, and non crowds. Great gem in Chicago!"
110,The Signature Room,This place is great! Not only is the view of the Chicago skyline great but so is the food. It‚Äôs a little pricey but who cares! It‚Äôs worth it.
111,The Signature Room,"The Signature Room at the 95th¬Æ is at the 95 th story of the 100 story skyscrapper called The John Hancock Center. You can see the  beautiful panoramic view of the Chicago city and Lake Michigan. The 95th floor named the Signature Room, with an accompanying bar on the 96th floor called the Signature Lounge. Enjoyed the view from up there with our drinks. We ordered a PAMA Kiss, an Orange Signature Room Punch and another one which name I forgot. If you are visiting Chicago, this should be in your list."
112,The Signature Room,One of my favorite places!! Food is absolutely delicious and there are so many choices! The view is breathtaking! I've been here many times and can't wait to go back!
113,The Signature Room,Amazing restaurant with jaw dropping views!  One of the coolest restaurants I have ever been to!  I would definitely recommend this restaurant for a very fun experience!
114,The Signature Room,Awesome views and the most amazing brunch ever. Located on the 95th floor of the John Hancock Tower in downtown Chicago. Located right on Michigan Ave. Why pay for the observation deck when you can pay slightly more and get the same view with the most spectacular brunch you'll ever have.

116,The Signature Room,"It was our anniversary and one of our favorite cities is Chicago. I wanted to make the evening special and knew about this restaurant but had never been there (did the tourist thing at the 360, however). I set up a reservation online, with the notes of that it was our anniversary, and I wanted a window seat overlooking the downtown area for the evening."
117,The Signature Room,"Upon arrival, we were greeted warmly and were wished a happy anniversary (nice touch!). They placed us at a table exactly where I had asked (even though I know they have a disclaimer saying they can't guarantee a window seat).  We were both really pleased of the view our table had, especially during the evening."
118,The Signature Room,The service was excellent! They attended to our every need and obviously really cared about our experience and happiness. We both got a prime cut steak dinner and to say it was beyond succulent would be an understatement.  Was probably the best steak I've ever had along with the mashed potatoes that we asked for.
119,The Signature Room,"We weren't there for the drinks, so never experienced the bar area above - we were there for a romantic evening and to feel pampered and the Signature Room staff and management delivered!"
120,The Signature Room,"Throughout the meal they remembered why we there, and upon ordering a dessert to end the evening, they had a thoughtful touch added.  Thank you for a wonderful and memorable evening!"
121,The Signature Room,"The word ""delicious"" hardly does the food here justice. Each dish from the side of creamy mashed potatoes and pan seared duck to the New York strip steak was seasoned and cooked to perfection. Also, the staff was very attentive, seeing to it that we lacked nothing. The hostess was so warm and friendly, we felt entirely at home even though we were a smidge late for our reservation. If you're looking for somewhere memorable to celebrate a special occasion, I absolutely recommend this place. If you can time your visit to coincide with sunset as our group did, even better!"
122,The Signature Room,"This place is absolutely perfect. I had a very nice meal with my family. Restaurant was bigger than I thought. The best thing about the restaurant was the service. It was excellent! Especially, when they asked where are you from  and when I answered. Soon they brought a desert.Guess what? On the top of the dessert there was my country flag and US flag too. The food was delicious and full of flavor. The restaurant was on the top of the building,95th. Cause of that it has nice view to entire city of Chicago. Prices are a little bit high, but it worth it. I can't wait to come back!"
123,The Signature Room,"Great view. Amazing staff. Exceedingly courteous and helpful. Drinks were great, seafood tasted fresh and everything was cooked, seasoned, prepared and plated to perfection. I heard no complaints from anyone in our vicinity. Truly an amazing place to eat."
124,The Signature Room,A gorgeous restaurant located in the 95th floor of Hancock Tower that offers such a beautiful view of downtown Chicago and Lake Michigan.
125,The Signature Room,"It is divided into The Room- the Restaurant, which definitely belongs to the more expensive category, where you‚Äôre easily able to spent over 300$ for 4people. And secondly the Lounge, where you can just a get a drink and enjoy the view."
126,The Signature Room,"When my parents were visiting me, I took them  to have a dinner there. The menu does not offer a lot of things and mostly offers steaks and chicken courses. To be honest, I think, the menu could be more various. But overall the food was very good, but I just don‚Äôt think it was worth the price... I get it, it is more about the experience and the view than food itself. So that is why I would probably more recommend just to go to The Lounge and get a drink, you‚Äôll save a lot of money and still have a good experience!"
127,The Signature Room,"Wow. Wow. Wow. Don't think just go!! Located on the 95th floor of the John Hancock Tower in downtown Chicago. Fully accessible, nice service and great drinks! The views here are not to be missed!"
128,The Signature Room,"The view was amazing. The food was good too! I had lobster mac and cheese. It could of had a little more salt, but was very tasty. My husband had the Angus burger, also very good. I was to full to have dessert! The atmosphere was elegant, staff amazing. The view even better! I've never seen Chicago from that angle!!"
129,The Signature Room,"This was a wonderful Valentine's Day experience.  We had a reservation, so they were able to sit is within 10 minutes of arrival, and the wait staff was there just a minute later.  The food was absolutely delicious, and it did not take as long as expected being as busy as they were for the occasion.  Everything combined to make this a very special surprise for my wife, and she was thrilled with the entire evening!"
130,The Signature Room,"It was absolutely breathtaking. Great cocktail, excellent service."
131,The Signature Room,I ordered Old Fashion and it was deliciously refreshing. Host was kind to let us choose a seat of our choice. They greeted on arrival and fast in service.
132,The Signature Room,"We were able to walk around and enjoy the view, which is amazing (except when it‚Äôs foggy)."
133,The Signature Room,Reservation is advised but we were lucky for a non-busy Wednesday evening (9PM) to have a seat without reservation.
134,The Signature Room,I definitely recommend this place if view and good cocktails is something that you desire. Please check their menu for prices.
135,The Signature Room,"That was an incredible place to go! Wonderfull view, great staff and ""normal"" price."
136,The Signature Room,Absolutely breathtaking. An experience beyond  expectations. Must be done if you are in Chicago. Best for dates. Staff is super friendly and the food tastes great.
137,The Signature Room,"First time here for their brunch. Couldn‚Äôt have been happier with the buffet items as well as their entrees! Our server Jeremy was a pleasure, and very attentive. Amazing pianist played great songs throughout, and the view was breathtaking. Only reason why I gave 4 stars is because the bathrooms were not as nice as I thought they‚Äôd be. They were pretty small and seemed dirty. Other restaurants of the same category have flawless bathrooms!"
138,The Signature Room,"It's the second time that I'm here. I love love this place. Yes, prices are a little bit high, but let's be honest, worth it! Enjoying the view while sipping a cocktail is priceless! This time I also tried a cheesecake. That's the reason I put just 4 stars. Wasn't really impressed. Next time will try a different dessert. But maybe as a bar it shouldn't have nice desserts?! Not sure! Enjoyed the view! Love love love it!"
139,The Signature Room,One of the most beautiful and memorable experience I've ever had. Definitely one of the best places to take your second half to.
140,The Signature Room,"I made a special arrangement for my dates birthday, consisting of rose petals on the table, chocolate cover strawberries, and a customized menu. I was very impressed with how the waiters treated us. The food and drinks were outstanding and the strawberries were even better. The view was amazing and definitely added to romantic dinner."
141,The Signature Room,"Best deal is the raw bar for $55.00. You can order it for 2 as an appetizer or just for one seafood lover's dinner. You get a lobster tail, jumbo shrimp, oysters, and king crab legs! Their steaks and lamb are also worth it. Best for special occasions or when loved ones come to visit. Nothing beats the view. Ladies, make sure to check out the restroom....floor to ceiling glass, take as many selfies as you want while waiting to use the loo! Just make sure your date doesn't get hungry waiting!"
142,The Signature Room,We had a brunch in the most wonderful and beautiful ambience with an extraordinary view which we unfortunately were not able to see because of clouds. The buffet has more than you could wish for with seafood including oysters and many sweet things. You can also order hot dishes such as hamburger and Egg Benedict. Everything delicious with an exception of the shrimps. They were rather tasteless.
143,The Signature Room,"Been traveling on work for 11 years to Chicago.  Always stay downtown and have been to many amazing places and local gems!  We had a few hours this last trip and I suggested we do something ‚Äútouristy‚Äù!  We decided upon this place.  What took me so long??? This was one of the best views I‚Äôve ever had of Chicago!  And I work in one of the tallest buildings in Chicago..highly recommend and the drinks were just as good!!!!!   LADIES-  go straight to the women‚Äôs restroom....the best view!!! Trust me, you‚Äôll see!"
144,The Signature Room,Fantastic view! Good service and nice drinks. Bit of a tourist-trap though. Still worth a visit for the view alone
145,The Signature Room,Thoroughly enjoyed coming here. Me and three friends came 30 minutes before sunset and enjoyed the views very much. The staff really know how to kindly and efficiently organize the lines to get everyone in the elevators and find a table quickly. We were able to get up and walk around to get good pictures and also enjoyed our drinks. Would recommend coming at sunset!
146,The Signature Room,"Great place to be at night. Don't pay for skyscraper view, go to the bar here and purchase a beer to enjoy the view of a lifetime. Food was great and cocktails are solid! Affordable prices. Get there before 7-8pm to avoid wait time."
147,The Signature Room,"This is a very nice and beautiful restaurant. The staff are friendly and the food is good. You get amazing views of Chicago and Lake Michigan. It is obviously very expensive, but that‚Äôs part of the experience. There isn‚Äôt any cell service on the top though, which is funny."
148,The Signature Room,Great bar/restaurant. You can get the overview from the city and have a drink or quick bite. Bartender was really helpful and very kind. Thank you for the great experience!
149,The Signature Room,It's worth it! If i live in Chicago this would be the place I'd go to for every celebration.  Quality good quality service.  The best!
150,The Signature Room,"I love this place!! I was taken here to celebrate my birthday. The ambiance is amazing and the view is spectacular!!! It is pricey but worth every penny!! The staff was very attentive, prompt, and friendly! The wait was a little long considering we had reservations but I feel sorry for the ones that go and do not make reservations. I can‚Äôt wait to go back and recommend you giving it a try as well."
151,The Signature Room,"We made a reservation for a Sunday brunch. We started with appetizers, our choice was crab legs, oysters, shrimp, smoked salmon and Blue cheese. Great quality food! For the main course our waiter, Ron, recommended the lamb chops and grilled trout. Both items were perfectly cooked and delicious. Thank you, Ron! For a desert I decided to try crepes with nutella and vanilla ice cream. Yumm! The view was fenomenal! We experienced a very memorable time! Wish to come back soon."
152,The Signature Room,"I love this restaurant , went there celebrating my birthday , food delicious, amazing view for the city of chicago great service"
153,The Signature Room,"This place is now a fine dining restaurant and they do tell you that before you get seated.  Came to the restaurant mainly because of the gorgeous view of the city and trust me if you want to impress anyone, bring them here.  The restaurant has a dark romantic setting and the service is great as well.  However, i didn‚Äôt expect the food to be so good.  The lamb was cooked perfectly and was well seasoned.  Also the seafood was good as well.  I highly recommend the lamb dish.  Expect to spend $50 a person as you definitely will enjoy having a drink with the view."
154,The Signature Room,"Yes it is pricey and hard to get into and most of us working class folk have to plan our vacation time around a visit to this restaurant.  But, it is worth it. The views, the food, the wine selections, the impeccable service.  Loved it all. One of the highlights of our year. We can't wait to return."
155,The Signature Room,We have been to Signatute Room before and loved it! We had high hopes for the brunch buffet but even then we we're blown away!! The crab legs were HUGE!! The shrimp tasted so fresh!! The artichoke beignets were so crispy and cheesey! My daughter got the ribs and loved them!! My other girls inhaled their french toast! The eggs Benedict was superb! I would have eaten several plates if I could have! My husbands steak and egga was so tender! The grits with it may have been the best I ever had!! We already have plans to come back on our next trip! Almost forgot to mention the dessert!! Those crepes are phenomenal!! A must hit!!
156,The Signature Room,This‚Äôs a great place Or any occasion.  Beautiful and great Service at all Times. Dr. Earnestine Clayton
157,The Signature Room,"Come here often because I like to take visitors here. However, there one server I sometimes got. Quite judging. All people in my table are black hair. She ignored us always. I wanted to let her know that mama I live in Chicago. I work in Chicago. I also a server. So please don't judging us. I know how to tip"
158,The Signature Room,"Went here for the first time for brunch and it was Farr-tastic! The food was yummy and the servers were exceptional.  Best to make a reservation because it can be a popular place, mainly because of the breathtaking views of the lake and the city!! It will always be a special place for us, because we got engaged there! Drinks were pricey, but its totally worth the experience! Ask for Patrick! He's the best!!"
159,The Signature Room,Really loved the view and the food. They tend to customize the items on the menu based on your preferences which is really nice for people who are vegan/vegetarian.
160,The Signature Room,"Best way to experience a view of Chicago. Was quite busy when we went on a Sunday afternoon so no window seat but we were able to walk about to get some great views. No entry charge, just get the lift to the 96th floor."
161,The Signature Room,Tower to go to to get an amazing view!!
162,The Signature Room,"I would recommend to not do the 360 and pay for the view. Instead. Go to the 96th floor to the signature room and get a drink and enjoy the view! Less expensive and you get a magical experience! Fully accessible, nice service and great drinks!! Enjoy!"
163,The Signature Room,"Let‚Äôs be honest, you‚Äôre paying for the views. The place isn‚Äôt the best for vegetarians, as their menu is limited if you‚Äôre looking for a satisfying meal that doesn‚Äôt have meat. However, the food you do get is pretty good and the service was excellent. Expect to pay a little more than you would in other places, but you cannot beat the view anywhere in Chicago! Always worth the dining experience, just to look out at the city and the lake!!!"
164,The Signature Room,This place is a gem! Not only offers a romantic vibe and delicious food for special occasions but also welcomes you for a casual date night at the bar where you can enjoy the view and desserts!
165,The Signature Room,"Brunch here was freaking awesome! 60 bucks a person for unlimited entrees and buffet bar. I think that is great since you get to be up so high. Sadly it was cloudy as pictured but still, on a clear day would be worth the 60 bucks! The staff was super nice too. Definitely come here if you never been to  Chicago."
166,The Signature Room,This is a very elegant place! Our first time visiting and to celebrate our birthday for the weekend. I recommend going to this place and may I suggest the grilled pork chops with black rice! It is quite exquisite!
167,The Signature Room,Went here for my birthday in January. The night views were breath taking. Live music and the mood was calm and cozy. We sat by the windows. I had the lobster tails which were SOOOOOOO GOOD. My now fiance tried it and he don't eat fish like that and said it was pretty delicious. Overall great time! ( he proposed the next day feb 1stüòç)
168,The Signature Room,"This place is must if you're visiting Chicago for a couple of days. I hung out at the sky deck lounge during happy hour , ordered some affordable wine, and watched the city light up as the sun went down. It wasn't too crowded on a late Tuesday afternoon.  Then I headed to the restaurant ,which was really expensive but worth it because of the view. People started to roll in in the evening and the place got really lively. Food portions were a good size and service was decent."
169,The Signature Room,"Had the most incredible birthday dinner here last weekend! Champagne, rose petals, a personalized menu, and a beautiful cake - all paired with amazing food, wonderful service from Bob, and gorgeous views. Watching the sunset and seeing the city lights glow from the 95th floor added to the romantic atmosphere of the evening. The tomato and burrata salad was delicious, as were the scallops! This was a night I will never forget! Thank you Bob and The Signature Room at the 95th for making me feel like a princess!"
170,The Signature Room,"The environment is amazing - the staff is friendly, the view is breathtaking, and the food is fantastic. The rolls were filled with rosemary. The Brussels sprouts were some of the best that I‚Äôve ever had! I can say the same about the whipped potatoes. The meat will melt in your mouth beautifully. I ordered the salmon which was okay, it was cooked well, however I wasn‚Äôt a fan of the mushroom risotto they served it with. We ordered desserts - the lemon olive oil cake was AMAZING, as was the creme br√ªl√©e, and peppermint cheesecake."
171,The Signature Room,"The perfect place to sip a martini while watching the sunset with your hunny! Little known fact is that the view is better from here than from the Sears Tower. I highly suggest you do the dinner and sunset thing, it's an excellent spot for it. It will make you feel among the clouds and build beautiful memories."
172,The Signature Room,"First of all my expectations when going to 95th for dinner were not low. Have heard about this place and just hoped experience will match what I have heard. Well it did not, 95th surprised and exceeded what I hoped for. First of all, staff is very pleasant and courteous. Place has magnificent atmosphere not only because of views from the window but thanks to great service. Food was really amazing, probably one of the best steaks I have tried so far. Desert looks fabulous. Live piano music just topped it off. Will be coming back!"
173,The Signature Room,"Checked out the Signature Room on my last evening in Chicago. Very fine place to dine indeed... 95th floor up - amazing views as you can see! Interior is a bit dated however a cool experience. I think it was meant to be silver service, very posh none the less but maybe a bit overkill for this day in-age? Food was fairly good, nothing super amazing but tbh good grub none the less... I decided to eat here as the price to eat was not much more than the tourist attraction skydeck = win!"
174,The Signature Room,"All about the views which are suitably awesome. Don‚Äôt expect a lot from the food and drink, generic and uninspired. The decor is dated but you‚Äôll be staring out of the windows anyway so what does it matter!"
175,The Signature Room,This is a true 360 Degrees view of Chicago on the 95th floor. It's a large place they serve brunch they serve dinners they have a bar you can sit on the edge of the window and watch Chicago by night and by day the view is great. the staff is great.Just pick your direction and enjoy. I prefer east and south. It's crazy busy during weekends I always go during weeknights.
176,The Signature Room,This bar deserves 5 stars due to the experience while drinking. Located just about in the clouds of the Hancock building is the Signature Room. We arrived and had a table within 15 minutes. Staff was very friendly and attentive. I had a Passion Fruit Mule which had so much flavor. Drinks are expensive but for a once in a while treat you should try it out.
177,The Signature Room,"Atmosphere here is fabulous, we had the Godiva Chocolate Martini. Also the Baileys Irish Cream Chocolate chip cheesecake. Best ten dollar dessert. The views here are not to be missed!"
178,The Signature Room,The view from our table was one of the most amazing sights that I've seen. It is a high end place that is family friendly. The service was incredible and keeps up with their reputation. Many people have told me to visit their and I will do the same. The Baked Cheese Ravioli was amazing and I would order it again. The 95th floor height view was breath taking and is worth a trip to Chicago.
179,The Signature Room,"Great food, service was not up to par with our waiter but other waiters picked up the slack and were fair to us. Air is constantly on, be prepared for the cold breeze. Food is well prepared, staff is friendly and tables and area is well cleaned and kept."
180,The Signature Room,I have been going here for years ! when family visits us or for a special occasion. It does cost a lot of money but I try to stop in at least once a year. I usually just get one or two drinks and either a dessert or a appetizer (because of the cost) but the view is out of the world!  It also holds very special memories for me because the 1st time I took my husband there to show him the view is when he proposed to me! Every employee is extremely professional and friendly.  It's a nice place to go during the day with your children.
181,The Signature Room,What a place....! Amazing views. Went up close to dawn time and the view was spectacular. You get up with an elevator after the restaurant stop. We got lucky to be seated right next to the window. And discovered spiders climb out of the building to these heights. Highly recommended! And of course is a bit touristy but worth a visit
182,The Signature Room,"We went here in lieu of doing the Willis Tower view and it was definitely worth it. We waited a little while to make sure we could get a table along the windows for maximum view -- but it only took about 15 minutes to get that spot, so not long at all. The views were absolutely stunning. The cocktails were very expensive (average $17) and they were only so-so, but when you consider you'd pay $25 to do the Willis tower and NOT get a cocktail, then I'd say it's definitely worth the extra cost."
183,The Signature Room,"Beautiful location, spectacular view, drinks available in variety, we tried there starters were pretty decent. Staff is okay. Service is average. It could be better. But the scenic view is the best experience. must go place to see the city from 96th floor."
184,The Signature Room,"Indescribable view and excellent food. Upscale yet not completely formal, amazing experience."
185,The Signature Room,"The Signature Room is great because you can get an amazing view of the Chicago skyline for free!  Our food was very good.  I had the white sangria drink and it was very refreshing!  You also don't have to wait in long lines or pay for the ""view"" if you eat at this restaurant.  I highly recommend this experience over the SkyDeck at Willis Tower."
186,The Signature Room,Its was a great brunch. The service was magnificent. Thank you for a wonderful. Thanksgiving meal!
187,The Signature Room,We went up for drinks on a Saturday afternoon they weren‚Äôt that busy but we unfortunately still didn‚Äôt get a window seat. Still were able to see the views. The women‚Äôs bathroom has the best view. Highly recommend if you don‚Äôt want to pay loads of money to see the city skyline.
188,The Signature Room,"Hard to beat the atmosphere, service, and food here. This is a destination to impress any guest you could bring either personal, business, or professional. You will create a memory they would not forget. See photos for views from our table."
189,The Signature Room,Just visit it an hour before sunset and have a drink while waiting for it. Much better experience than skyline and free view... unless you paying for a drink.
190,The Signature Room,"Overlooking the city of Chicago and lake Michigan with the best food in town, this place is simply breathtaking! The lamb chops I ordered (pictured below) was phenomenal! It's tender and flavorful, and easily the best lamb chops I ever had. During brunch, customers could help themselves with a wide selection of buffet, which ranges from salad to seafood and even dessert.  The staffs are well trained and professional, giving customers a wonderful dining experience. The Signature Room is hands down my favorite restaurant and will forever hold a special place in my heart."
191,The Signature Room,Came in for a light bite and drinks before heading off to our dinner reservation. Great raw bar option and loved the PAMA Kiss drink. Most of the staff was very friendly. Some could be better. Great place to check out the Chicago view.
192,The Signature Room,"We had a wonderful Thanksgiving feast!  I was originally skeptical of an 11 A reservation,  but bbn it vfc was terrific."
193,The Signature Room,The appetizer/dessert buffet was packed with great CV choices. The options for a main course (chosen from a menu) were varied and delicious.  We were seated by a window with a terrific view.
194,The Signature Room,I'm sure this will become an annual tradition!
195,The Signature Room,"Busy but what a view. Had appetizers and a bottle of wine, perfect way to end the day. The night time view was amazing!!!!"
196,The Signature Room,"Came here for a fancy dinner and it was better than I expected! I guess I didn't expect it to be very good because it has a great view already, so the food mustn't be good. But I enjoyed it! Got the seafood platter and it was fresh. I had the duck breasts and they were tender. The fish my boyfriend had was good too. Came here in the summer when Chicago has fireworks every weekend, and we watched the fireworks from up top. Beautiful!"
197,The Signature Room,It's a smart way to see the city since it has the same view as 360 but for the same price you can get a drink. It can get pretty busy though.
198,The Signature Room,"An experience of a lifetime. The customer service was excellent. The views unparalleled!! On a budget try to go in the late afternoon to watch the sunset fade into the city lights from the Lounge where you can order an affordable appetizer, dessert or soda. A highlight of our first visit to Chicago!"
199,The Signature Room,"The experience astounding, the food delicious, and the service great. Ate here my last night in Chicago during Chicago Restaurant Week which offered a 3 course meal for $48+. It was worth every penny. Unfortunately it was rainy so I didn't get a view, but I did get a window seat. The earlier you reserve your table the better chance you'll have of getting a window seat. The Lobster Bisque was creamy and rich. It's almost as if you could taste each individual spice and how they worked together to make a whole. The roasted salmon was delicious as well. The salmon itself wasn't too different from salmons I've had at other high class restaurants, but the chimichurri and sun dried tomato puree that accompanied it gave it an amazing unique flavor. The creme brulee was also pretty standard. All in all a great meal. My waiter Ryan and two of his associates were also great. 4/5 stars. I would like to see some more pazazz in the meal and a free coat check too since guests normally spend a significant amount of money (plus the money paid could be used as a tip to the person taking the coat)"
200,The Signature Room,"You come here for the view and because it's a cheaper alternative to the Sears Tower, but the drinks we had were incredible. After a wildly fast elevator ride to the top (I was a bit intoxicated so maybe it wasn't that wild), we were promptly seated near the windows and our drink order taken by a friendly waitress. I ordered a side car, and it was perfect. It was an overcast day, but periodically there were breaks in the clouds that would offer incredible views of Chicago and the lake. The price of a couple cocktails was cheaper than the admission into Sears Tower, so this is the way to go."
201,The Signature Room,Absolutely spectacular. Food and view are stunning
202,The Signature Room,"Unbeatable views for dining in Chicago. Sunday brunch even has a live pianist and unlimited crab legs and salmon. Service is great as well. I bring almost all my friends visiting to this place. Skip paying for the observatory and just spend your money here! Just $50 per person for brunch with unlimited seafood and main courses, with amazing views of Chicago. The supposed ‚Äúmain courses‚Äù or made to order meals part of the Sunday brunch is unlimited too. This is something I knew about after coming here a few times. The wait staff don‚Äôt really advertise this."
203,The Signature Room,"Up in the sky at 95th & 96th floors with a VIEW is the ""Signature"" Usually nothing is perfect anywhere so give stars means that when you take in consideration all that we all should: the location, the food quality, the service and... COST OF IT ALL as the bottom line. Now that every star it's 20% of the vote. I'd say it's not a  ten but not an 8 either if I was to go by the stars. A NINE would be my vote cause of the bottom line per person by the time you're done parking, eat and envoy. Service was great, food was good tough, coming back maybe."
204,The Signature Room,"I ate lunch here with a large party of co-workers. Prices were reasonable given the extraordinary views.  The website listed more options for food than the menu, but the restaurant was very accommodating in offering us these dishes as well.  They could use a bit more variety in the dishes.  For instance, they could use a few more vegetarian options.  I would definitely go there again."
205,Shanghai Terrace,"This is a 5 star, vegetarian-friendly, fine-dining place specialized in Chinese and Asian food which also serves alcohol."
206,Shanghai Terrace,"Outstanding cuisine and impeccable friendly service. Our waiter, Matt, was engaging and welcoming and provided wonderful suggestions. The specialty drinks are delightful and worth the price. Great spot for a special occasion or celebration especially on a beautiful summer night. Shredded duck is a great entr√©e but the vegetarians and vegans in our group were also very pleased with their options."
207,Shanghai Terrace,great service. drinks were fantastic. Dragon might be the best drink i have ever had. quite pricey though.
208,Shanghai Terrace,"One of the most favorite restaurants of all time.

Relative to Chinese food, it's fantastic.  Very upscale, but tasty in a way that you'll appreciate.

The prices of the food are in the upper tier, but the service they provide demands this.   You'll never be so well taken care of by staff than at this place. Dim sum is affordable for casual appetizers.

The is an outside terrace open in the summer.  This sits right beside the magnificent mile.  You can walk from the restaurant area toward the street and look out upon the magnificent mile if you wish.   Really amazing rooftop dining area, one of the best I've ever been to.   In the winter, the terrace becomes a rooftop ice skating rink.  Great for the kids.

If you come here, you'll love it."
209,Shanghai Terrace,Wonderful food... outstanding service! Thanks Max for a great experience!
210,Shanghai Terrace,"This restaurant deserves to be in my top 5. View is spectacular. Service is amazing. Food is soo delicious. We ordered Peking duck, dumplings and seafood. Everything was yumi. Can‚Äôt wait going back there."
211,Shanghai Terrace,"Outstanding cuisine and impeccable friendly service. Our waiter, Matt, was engaging and welcoming and provided wonderful suggestions. The specialty drinks are delightful and worth the price. Great spot for a special occasion or celebration especially on a beautiful summer night. Shredded duck is a great entr√©e but the vegetarians and vegans in our group were also very pleased with their options."
212,Shanghai Terrace,"This is a must-go place if you like Chinese food. The Peking duck originated from Beijing, China. But Shanghai Terrace has the best duck in Chicago. The service is really good. We‚Äôve tried serval dishes, all of which were very tasteful . However , the price is relatively high . Take that into consideration prior to making the reservation. :)"
213,Shanghai Terrace,great service. drinks were fantastic. Dragon might be the best drink i have ever had. quite pricey though.
214,Shanghai Terrace,"Hands down, the best experience! Food is fantastic! Service beyond excellent! Many people said you have to go to Chinatown for authentic Chinese food, wait until you try Shaghai Terrace...MIND BLOWING"
215,Shanghai Terrace,"Lived up to the hype far as I'm concerned. Had a great dinner here on a quiet Sunday evening. Sat outside at the bar to enjoy the perfect weather on a July night. The bartender was professional and engaging. I ordered the Peking Duck salad and a half portion of Kung Pao chicken. The salad was not only filling and delicious, but a work of art that I kind of hated to demolish with my fork. On the entr√©e, I enjoy extremely spicy food, so I requested extra spicy. So often I have done that only to get an extra pepper pod or something. These chefs actually took my request serious! Very hot and just the way I liked it. Absolutely no negatives here, it is pricey but you can order half portions (which will do the job). Definitely returning."
216,Shanghai Terrace,"This restaurant deserves to be in my top 5. View is spectacular. Service is amazing. Food is soo delicious. We ordered Peking duck, dumplings and seafood. Everything was yumi. The ambiance is wonderful. Can‚Äôt wait going back there."
217,Shanghai Terrace,"We tried tasting menu. Good quality, but not quite right. Ala cart probably could be better choice. Service and setting is wonderful. Nice place. Might go there again."
218,Shanghai Terrace,"No wonder this is voted the best Chinese Restaurant around here. Excellent food, even better hospitality. They even got us a complimentary dessert for our special occasion which was even more delicious."
219,Shanghai Terrace,"If you have a chance to dine here, do not pass it up & if the weather permits‚Äîsit on the terrace. From the service to the dessert, it was all amazing. They also were very accommodating to our vegetarian restrictions."
220,Shanghai Terrace,Wonderful food... outstanding service! Thanks Max for a great experience!
221,Shanghai Terrace,"This is one of my new favorite Chicago places!  I've always heard great things about this place and for good reason. This is a very romantic and impressive place to bring a date, impress co-workers or a boss and even for a classy night out with the girls/guys."
222,Shanghai Terrace,The food is delicious as well as the cocktails!
223,Shanghai Terrace,Shanghai terrace is amazing.  One of the most favorite restaurants of all time.
224,Shanghai Terrace,"Relative to Chinese food, it's fantastic.  Very upscale, but tasty in a way that you'll appreciate."
225,Shanghai Terrace,"The prices of the food are in the upper tier, but the service they provide demands this.   You'll never be so well taken care of by staff than at this place. Dim sum is affordable for casual appetizers."
226,Shanghai Terrace,"The is an outside terrace open in the summer.  This sits right beside the magnificent mile.  You can walk from the restaurant area toward the street and look out upon the magnificent mile if you wish.  Really amazing rooftop dining area, one of the best I've ever been to.   In the winter, the terrace becomes a rooftop ice skating rink.  Great for the kids."
227,Shanghai Terrace,"So we decided to take a break from pizza and instead stepped onto the oasis, Shanghai Terrace, tucked into the Peninsula hotel. Beautiful, relaxing rooftop terrace. Recommend going after the sun goes down or eat inside. It was a gorgeous night, with gentle breezes. The staff was all super friendly and attentive. Smaller portions, but very tasty so i'll give it a üëçüëç for the experience."
228,Shanghai Terrace,chinese food... my favorite treat. I often meet people here to talk. Service is typically great.
229,Shanghai Terrace,"Fantastic service, incredible food. We sampled the dim sum and the peking duck. Both were loved by our group. Our server was highly attentive and welcoming. It was one of the most enjoyable meals I've had in a long time. I can't recommend the Shanghai Terrace enough."
230,Shanghai Terrace,Impeccable service! Food is generally good and authenticÔºåhowever a bit disappointed with the Xiao Lung Bao which were broken as soon as you pick one up with chopsticks. All the juice came out. Happened to the whole container. It is meant to be contained before you put the dumpling in your mouth to taste the juice with meat ball inside the dumplings.
231,Shanghai Terrace,"One of my favorite place downtown! Great lunch specials. Definitely try their panang curry, chicken pad Thai, Thai iced I love coming here"
232,Shanghai Terrace,"My girlfriend and I celebrated her birthday at Shanghai Terrace. The food was good overall, we enjoy Asian food and this hit the spot. The service was very good and we were attended to promptly and everyone was very pleasant. We had a memorable nigh and will return."
233,Shanghai Terrace,Perfect in every aspects. Best Chinese cuisine in Chicago. Exceptional cocktails in the city. Top services. I highly recommend Shanghai Terrace over TAO or any hi end Chinese restaurant in the city.
234,Shanghai Terrace,"Great place! If you go during summer you have to sit in the terrace, lovely views. The dim sums are great, love the vegetables and lobster. The duck and wagyu rice is super b! For dessert you have to order the coconut key lime pie with a great cup of green tea."
235,Shanghai Terrace,I love everything about this restaurant. The food is out of this world. The dim sum is a must. Make sure you don‚Äôt leave without someone from the table ordering the Peking Duck. Best I have ever had. It was even better then the Peking Duck we had in Singapore and Shanghai . You can‚Äôt have a bad dish here. Make sure you make a reservation. Bravo Shanghai Terrace.
236,Shanghai Terrace,"Immaculate restaurant. Worth the price. One of the best meals I‚Äôve ever had. The staff are courteous, kind, and thoughtful. It is overall an incredible experience!"
237,Shanghai Terrace,Tried this place once with a friend and I am addicted ever since. I enjoyed the excellent vibes and yummy dishes and drinks. Keep it up.
238,Shanghai Terrace,Food was excellent. While shareable it tends to run on the small size of shareable. We were a group of 5 and spent a majority of our trip over ordering because the portion size was bigger than anticipated and then at Shanghai Terrace we finally got the smaller portion sizes.
239,Shanghai Terrace,"I couldn‚Äôt give any more stars to this place! The food is exceptional, but the customer service is second to none. I had a lot of business in Chicago which kept me here for a week, and not once did I receive the same quality of service that our amazing waiter, Max, offered us. Max was so kind, genuine, and focused on his clientele.  I have never had a more professional experience with a server at any restaurant. Thank you, Max - I am looking forward to meeting you again!"
240,Shanghai Terrace,"We had lunch here on Labor Day. Service was a little slow but they could've been short staffed for the holiday. However, the lobster and crab dumplings were divine. I ordered the lunch special that had the most incredible set of 3 dumplings, bbq, veggie and shrimp with 2 amazing sauces. My mom had a tapioca pudding with fruit for dessert with a raspberry sauce that knocked my socks off. The servers were well trained and extremely attentive. We will back for dinner for sure!"
241,Shanghai Terrace,One of the bests meals I‚Äôve ever had. This is a really great restaurant. Chefs did a fantastic job with the meals they prepared.
242,Shanghai Terrace,"There are probably two reason why this is not a Michelin-star restaurant. First, the restaurant does not spend lavishly on flowers. Second, the food is aimed to perfection of classical Chinese dishes and not ""creative"" cuisine.  No molecular gastronomy here.  Simply 1000 years worth of the Middle Kingdom's secrets.  Who would have thought that three simply prepared and similar looking Chinese vegetables could be so delicious ?  This may be the best Chinese fine-dining restaurant in the world (yes, there is probably other more tasty fare in  some hutong in Beijing) The flavors at Shanghai Terrace are delicate and complex. The ""five flavor"" duck is extraordinary and n alternative to other items the might be more familiar to diners."
243,Shanghai Terrace,GREAT FOOD and awesome service!. I recommend this place to friends and family. I have no complaints.
244,Shanghai Terrace,"Beautiful patio. Great servers who recognized us and made some great recommendation. If every evening in Chicago can end like this, I might come out here more often."
245,Shanghai Terrace,Always make a reservation here when in Chicago.   Fantastic perfectly executed high end Chinese food.  The Peking duck is succulent and excellent as was the crispy beef tenderloin.   The dragon smoked cocktail was unique excellent and worth the high price. Highly recommend.  It is hard to find as it's not right off the street.  You have to go up the elevator to the hotel lobby then down a flight of stairs.  Well worth the effort.
246,Shanghai Terrace,"Excellent in every way. Quality over quantity and unsurpassed service. My experience here was truly among the best I've ever had in a restaurant. The atmosphere, service and food are all top quality. The menu is concise, the prices are high and the portions are modest, but the quality is excellent. The menu is not particularly adventurous. All of the items were familiar to me, but not the flavors. Everything I tried was in another realm from my previous experience with dishes by the same name. This is a really great place to go for quality over quantity. The portions are small but not silly micro ""tastes"" like some ultra fancy high culinary art establishments serve. It's not as expensive as a fancy steak house, but you also probably won't leave in a ""food coma."" This is elegant gourmet Chinese cooking that the Peninsula Hotel can be proud of."
247,Shanghai Terrace,We came with my handicapped father and the entire staff was so unbelievably helpful. Their patience as well as their mastery of the menu made it such an exemplary experience. The stellar food was just the cherry on top to an absolutely wonderful night!
248,Shanghai Terrace,Nice place with fantastic food and desserts.
249,Shanghai Terrace,Great location for delicious Chinese food. went there on a friday i think. the service was very friendly and kind. it has an awesome atmosphere. i can see why they have a lot of good reviews.
250,Shanghai Terrace,"Great customer service, food comes out fast. Drinks are lil pricey, avoid the liquor. Lots of ice...other than that, it's good."
251,Shanghai Terrace,Service was excellent. All of our needs were attended to. Staff was very friendly.
252,Shanghai Terrace,"Chinese food... excellent. I like it here, excellent food & service. I will be back with my relatives. The place has a great atmosphere."
253,Shanghai Terrace,If you like real chinese foods this is the place to go..miamüòãüòã
254,Shanghai Terrace,Good cozy place with decent food and drinks
255,Shanghai Terrace,"We had several different dishes and all the food was pretty good. I can't say it was the mind blowing experience others have experienced. My expectations of coming to San Francisco and eating in a ""Chinatown"" restaurant with some sense of flair were not really fulfilled, that being said it was good food reasonably priced and accommodating."
256,Shanghai Terrace,"Great experience and the food was impeccable. We were celebrating my wife's birthday and  the chocolate mousse that they served was a nice, thoughtful touch and very tasty. Looking forward to coming back when we are in the neighborhood."
257,Shanghai Terrace,"Chinese food here - super tasty. good place to catch up with friends. there was fast, efficient, and courteous service. prices were average for the menu."
258,Shanghai Terrace,"Such a charming and cozy restaurant! I reserved a table with my boyfriend for a romantic dinner, and that is exactly what we got! I was impressed with our waiter; friendly customer service, informativeness regarding the menu, and everything was accomplished in a timely fashion. The level of organization and cleanliness is very impressive. The 'white peony tea' is a must-have starter beverage! I believe their selection is high-grade, which is rare. The 'dim sum' selections I chose and the 'Shanghai three fried rice' were all wonderful. The 'vegetable plate' we had was delicious with very fresh bok choy. For dessert, I had the 'cherry almond cake' which was so delicious I actually started shedding tears."
259,Shanghai Terrace,"I look forward to my next visit! I plan on trying the lychee iced tea, duck meat platter, and once again taste the heavenly cherry almond cake, but alongside the Dows 10 year Tawny dessert wine. <3"
260,Shanghai Terrace,"The food was great, especially the desserts. The plastic chopsticks felt slightly slippery in the hands, but not unmanageable. The dessert was the highlight for me."
261,Shanghai Terrace,Hands down the best Chinese food in the country
262,Shanghai Terrace,"I came here with a professor and another student on the Professor's recommendation. Fairly typical Chinese food, the whole experience was good and the service was on point for a busy lunch hour. We all left stuffed, with leftovers!"
263,Shanghai Terrace,"A great place to be. Dim sum is excellent, main course - chicken - was not as spicey as I thought. But overall a very good expierence."
264,Shanghai Terrace,Fancy Chinese food with high end prices but the food was actually really good so I would come back again. Kung pao chicken was perfect and actually had a lot of chicken instead of just nuts which is usually how Kung pao is served at some places. The happy red rice was definitely the star. Crispy tofu was delicious and perfectly lightly fried. Could probably skip the super expensive drinks next time.
265,Shanghai Terrace,"Very nice. Presentation, attentiveness and flavor were exceptional."
266,Shanghai Terrace,"Awesome restaurant,everyone is so nice and the food is GREAT!!!"
267,Shanghai Terrace,This is the best Asian restaurant in Chicago. Hard stop.
268,Shanghai Terrace,I live down the street from this place and it‚Äôs our go to dim sum and Chinese food!!! Amazing service all the time . Managers here are very friendly and the staff go above and beyond.
269,Shanghai Terrace,We go to eat here frequently ! I have never ever been disappointed!
270,Shanghai Terrace,The price is amazing for the quality of food you get.
271,Shanghai Terrace,"Came with my fiancee to celebrate our new engagament while on vacation in Chicago. Shanghai Terrace went the extra mile to make the dinner truly special with champagne and mousse cake. Our servers, Ryan and Ju, were incredible and pleasant, and above all, the food was amazing. She had Peking duck, I had the Chilean sea bass in Szechuan sauce."
272,Shanghai Terrace,"The pork buns are delllllicccc, I loved the wonton soup as well great prices!!!! Friendly service what more can you ask for‚Äç."
273,Shanghai Terrace,"The Peninsula Hotel in general and the Shanghai Terrace in specific offer excellence at a high price.  Everything about the place is excellent/outstanding. The food is some of the best Asian in the US. Service is spot on; fast knowledgeable and polite. Decor makes you feel like you are in Shanghai. In good weather, I particularly enjoy the outdoor dining. Highly recommended for those who want the best and are willing to pay the premium price."
274,Shanghai Terrace,"pricy However is worth the price, want to impress your girl come here"
275,Shanghai Terrace,Very pleasant atmosphere and drinks üç∏ üç∑ üçπ Not sure about the food ü•ò
276,Shanghai Terrace,"Excellent cuisine. Not the typical ""chinese restaurant"". Great service."
277,Shanghai Terrace,"Great home cooked feel and taste. Quaint, nice staff and very good comfort food. The Chinese doughnut dipped in the preserved egg porridge was very good."
278,Shanghai Terrace,Impeccable service! Food is generally good and authenticÔºåhowever a bit disappointed with the Xiao Lung Bao which were broken as soon as you pick one up with chopsticks. All the juice came out. Happened to the whole container. It is meant to be contained before you put the dumpling in your mouth to taste the juice with meat ball inside the dumplings.
279,Shanghai Terrace,This place has a beautiful atmosphere and shockingly enough the food is just as good.
280,Shanghai Terrace,"Superior restaurant, the only place I will have the dim sum. Does not disappoint, very beautiful and expert servers."
281,Shanghai Terrace,"Amazing food. Loved their sea food dumplings. Although, I recommend visiting this place in summer. In winter in door ambience kinda okayish.."
282,Shanghai Terrace,Amazing food. Great signature cocktails. Excellent service.
283,Shanghai Terrace,"Food, service and ambiance are great! If u have the chance to sit outside, it‚Äôs amazing."
284,Shanghai Terrace,Really really good! Will certainly be arriving back once more. The area is actually good for me.
285,Shanghai Terrace,"We visited Feb 2nd and ran into an issue with our dinner, but management followed up and resolved the problem. Their response was timely and helpful."
286,Shanghai Terrace,"Beautiful interior, but we were just there for drinks on the terrace, the crowd was still pretty fancy. Only a few specialty drinks offered which was a bit of a disappointment but we did love the complementary cheese crisp, spicy nuts and wasabi peas that were even refilled. Service was great. Patio seats at least 100 I would say with some great views of Michigan Ave and the John Hancock."
287,Shanghai Terrace,Definitely a great spot to grab a drink and some city views where other that the occasional siren you feel miles above the hustle and bustle of Michigan Avenue below!
288,Shanghai Terrace,Good place good service very good food I would recommend this
289,Shanghai Terrace,"The atmosphere was gorgeous, the staff was elegant and courteous, and the food was hands down amazing!"
290,Shanghai Terrace,Truly exciting dumplings.
291,Shanghai Terrace,"The combination of restful setting, superb food and faultless service make this Chicago‚Äôs best Chinese restaurant, and one of its top restaurants overall. It‚Äôs particularly delightful when it‚Äôs warm enough to eat on the terrace, a surprisingly serene environment considering it‚Äôs just a half dozen or so floors above Michigan Avenue."
292,Shanghai Terrace,"We put ourselves in our waiter‚Äôs hands, and he assembled a delightful multi-course meal for us."
293,Shanghai Terrace,"We began with an assortment of six pieces of dim sum, individually plated for each of us. This item is not listed on the menu (nor is any form of dim sum sampler) so it is worth asking about. Although I am not a huge dim sum fan, this was clearly the best I have ever had; each was light and flavorful, and even the crab rangoon managed to be delicate and appealing."
294,Shanghai Terrace,"Next we shared a split serving of hot and sour soup, also the best I‚Äôve had, with less vinegar and more broth flavor. Plenty of tender lobster chunks made it special."
295,Shanghai Terrace,"Peking duck is available in a full or half portion, and the half is perfect for sharing as an appetizer. It‚Äôs served with the traditional cucumber, scallions, pancakes and sauces, but the duck was so perfect we ate most of it by itself. Crispy skin and no layer of fat at all made it among the best duck dishes I‚Äôve had. Next time I might try the five spice duck to compare it."
296,Shanghai Terrace,"For entrees we shared scallops in black truffle sauce, and a spicy shrimp dish. Both were good, and were different from anything else we‚Äôd had, but I felt the preceding courses were better."
297,Shanghai Terrace,"Perhaps the highlight of the meal was an amazing red rice dish that I didn‚Äôt see on the menu. It was vegetarian, and included various nuts, broccoli and other tidbits, and had a rich, mouth-filling flavor that was remarkable. I would definitely ask for this again."
298,Shanghai Terrace,"Finally we finished with a fruit and sorbet plate. Our waiter added a bit of coconut sorbet, which turned out to be the highlight."
299,Shanghai Terrace,"A well-conceived wine list offers many selections designed to accompany the food, including a small half bottle section. Wine prices are erratic, with some barely above retail, and others sky high, so careful browsing is required, but will be rewarded."
300,Shanghai Terrace,"This was a great meal, and I‚Äôm sure we will return often to this surprising oasis in the midst of the city."
301,Shanghai Terrace,We visited Shanghai Terrace this past weekend and had a good experience! A few positives:
302,Shanghai Terrace,1. The environment was great. It's located in the lower level of the Peninsula Hotel. We went during the holidays so the outside light display was outstanding. The actual restaurant itself is a little small but in a cozy way.
303,Shanghai Terrace,"2. The food was good! We had the spicy beef potstickers both steamed and friend (recommend steamed) and the Golden Shrimp (outstanding) to start. Notable entrees were the kung pao chicken, the Chilean Sea Bass in Traditional Szechwan Sauce, and the Spicy Crispy Beef Tenderloin, and the fried rice (totally recommend). We also ordered the 1/2 Peking Duck... more on that in a moment. It was just okay IMO."
304,Shanghai Terrace,3. Staff was kind and the front host was quick and polite!
305,Shanghai Terrace,"4. Drinks were tasty. I ordered a New Zealand Sauvignon Blanc and the guys at my table were sipping on Sour Cherry Old Fashioned's. Those had ginger beer in them. When they were made right they were really refreshing and good but sometimes too much ginger beer. My mom was drinking a cocktail called the ""horse"" which included pear-vanilla puree, lemon cordial, st. germain, prosecco. Delicious but also more of a brunch type of drink."
306,Shanghai Terrace,"Top quality and awesome food and services, So I was really enjoyed and loved all services.Thank You!!"
307,Shanghai Terrace,"Superior service, excellent food and drinks."
308,Shanghai Terrace,"Simply delicious, impeccable setting and  service. Loved the wonton soup and duck salad"
309,Shanghai Terrace,"Terrific upscale Chinese, get the soup dumplings or you've failed.  Our waiter was tremendous, he couldn't have been better"
310,Shanghai Terrace,Service was outstanding! Food was fresh & delicious! I highly recommend this place!
311,NoMI Kitchen,"This is a 5 star, vegetarian-friendly, fine-dining place specialized in French and American food with a good wine menu."
312,NoMI Kitchen,"My first time trying Nomi, and I would highly recommend it to anyone. The atmosphere is great; the views are amazing; our food was delicious; and the service was spectacular. Our waiter was wonderful and really went above and beyond for us. Overall, it was a great experience. I will certainly be back."
313,NoMI Kitchen,"Took my daughter for a birthday lunch. We sat on the balcony and were waited on by the most charming gentlemen. The food was outstanding, the ambience perfect and overall it was a terrific experience."
314,NoMI Kitchen,"The eggs benedict were great!  The service/hospitality was incredible!!  My sister and I had a great time, thank you for the wonderful time!  I loved sitting in the outdoor area and the weather was just perfect, thank you for ordering the up too üòâ"
315,NoMI Kitchen,"Awesome spot to buy some food when in a rush. The customer service is speedy, pricing is reasonable, good ambience. Will come back again"
316,NoMI Kitchen,"Fantastic view, ambience. Best neighborhood patio that's tucked away above the street"
317,NoMI Kitchen,Amazing ambience and super personal service. The menu was crisp and delicious. Will clearly recommend this restaurant to anyone. Affordable prices and large meals. Keep up the great work.
318,NoMI Kitchen,"A lot of times, with restaurants housed within higher end hotels, you're essentially paying for the views and the grace of being within the hotel.  NoMi Kitchen is not one of those cases, the food here is top-notch."
319,NoMI Kitchen,"You're provided with warm bread and butter topped with pepper to begin and your culinary journey only increases from there.  The Caesar salad was very good, with the dressing being the best part of the entire salad.  But the main entree, the sushi rolls, were so good.  You could taste the individual components of the sushi as it melted in your tongue.  It may have literally been the best sushi I have ever had."
320,NoMI Kitchen,"Pricey, yes, but the food and the views make it well worth it."
321,NoMI Kitchen,"My first time trying Nomi, and I would highly recommend it to anyone. The atmosphere is great; the views are amazing; our food was delicious; and the service was spectacular. Our waiter was wonderful and really went above and beyond for us. Overall, it was a great experience. I will certainly be back."
322,NoMI Kitchen,"Nomi Kitchen is a fancy restaurant,with a professional and very friendly staff. While enjoying the delicious food,there is a great opportunity,to enjoy the view of N Michigan street. we‚Äôve had some warm bread with butter, young roasted chicken with beans, smoked octopus with hummus and a very soft baked chicken breast,with some pickled onions and mushrooms. I will definitely come back there, to try some sushi and desserts."
323,NoMI Kitchen,"Entered near eleven, it wasn't packed. I will probably become a regular. The place has a good feel to it. Like a restaurant in Washington I liked."
324,NoMI Kitchen,"Took my daughter for a birthday lunch. We sat on the balcony and were waited on by the most charming gentlemen. The food was outstanding, the ambience perfect and overall it was a terrific experience."
325,NoMI Kitchen,Very savory. The staff was very helpful and observant. The place has a nice feel to it.
326,NoMI Kitchen,"Fabulous place! Delicious food! The cozy and fancy decoration is good for dating or business. The Ravioli is tasty with that rich creamy flavor. The Streak is tender, well seasoned, juicy. Overall is perfect for my first time French restaurant adventure. Highly recommend"
327,NoMI Kitchen,"The eggs benedict were great!  The service/hospitality was incredible!!  My sister and I had a great time, thank you for the wonderful time!  I loved sitting in the outdoor area and the weather was just perfect, thank you for ordering the up too üòâ"
328,NoMI Kitchen,"One of my favorite place with the Peninsula for brunch, lunch or diner in Chicago. I go twice per month as minimum. I like the front window or the roof top, service is just nice and clean. Meals as well as bites from the starters to desert including bread are very good and creative! Pictures below were taken during my bday for breakfast"
329,NoMI Kitchen,Very excellent service and great food. Absolutely no complaints. Definitely deserves to be on the list of the top restaurants in Chicago.
330,NoMI Kitchen,"Sushi was on point, in fact everything was concerning the food. The service left something lacking. Peanut Butter and Jelly baked Alaska was incredible. Also had emerald crystal lettuce for the first time and it immediately jumped in to my top five vegetables. Ask them to garnish your sashimi/nigiri/sushi with some."
331,NoMI Kitchen,Very good upscale restaurant. Excellent 32 oz steak which is great for 2. The only thing steak was a little cold. Great selection of vines. Very good creme br√ªl√©e
332,NoMI Kitchen,"Fantastic view, ambience. Best neighborhood patio that's tucked away above the street"
333,NoMI Kitchen,"Well deserved 5 stars - service, food, location.. and for those of you who read the other reviews, heads up - portions large enough (at least for European taste)."
334,NoMI Kitchen,"Awesome spot to buy some food when in a rush. The customer service is speedy, pricing is reasonable, good ambience. Will come back again"
335,NoMI Kitchen,"A great venue, wonderful space overlooking The Magnificent Mile, Water Tower with views to Lake Michigan."
336,NoMI Kitchen,"Tremendous sushi, craft cocktails, large wine list. 5-star service."
337,NoMI Kitchen,The space is split between an upscale casual drinks lounge and a proper dinning room. The views are easily appreciable due to the history and attractions less than a block away in any direction. The wine selections are plentiful and the food I quite exquisite. Gorgeous date atmosphere as well as a semi-formal group.
338,NoMI Kitchen,I love this restaurant! Food is always consistently great. Wait staff is top notch.
339,NoMI Kitchen,"We visited on a Sunday evening and the main dining area was closed, but we wanted to sit outside in the garden area so this was of no consequence to us. The night time view was very nice, overlooking the magnificent mile. Service, including hostess, was attentive and friendly. For an upper scale restaurant, we found prices to be fair. The food was wonderful and their drink selection was plentiful. Highly recommend."
340,NoMI Kitchen,Valentines Day Date night with the wife. We had a Gorgeous View of the Mag Mile with our Window Table. Professional Service all around. We Relished every Dish from The Chefs Choice Sashimi/Sushi Platter to the Eat Coast & West Coast Oysters and Comforted by the Braised Beef Osso Bucco. My Wife and I still Embrace each other in the Reverie of our Date Night at Nomi. Quality Time Indeed.
341,NoMI Kitchen,I eat here a lot since I work in the area. I must say their service is always fantastic and they keep the place well kept consistently. Pricing is affordable and they serve large portions.
342,NoMI Kitchen,"Came for lunch over a weekend. Had to avocado toast. It was delicious - the tomatoes actually had flavor (unfortunately rare for tomatoes these days) and the capers were the perfect hint of salt for the dish. My cocktail was delicious as well. Service is a little slow (and it wasn‚Äôt even busy the day I went), but views were great and food was delicious, so I would return."
343,NoMI Kitchen,The food and service was incredible. We went as a team at work to celebrate. Definitely recommend for a very special occasion. The wine pairings were phenomenal.
344,NoMI Kitchen,"I really like the food and customer service, great location very close to my residence. The staff members are always very nice. Will come visit again."
345,NoMI Kitchen,The food and service were above my expectations. We really enjoyed the environment of this restaurant. Wonderful spot to take my family out for dinner.
346,NoMI Kitchen,Great food. Amazing service. Lovely ambience. Expensive.
347,NoMI Kitchen,Love the ambience and views! Awesome service. Food is 3.5/5.
348,NoMI Kitchen,Great cocktails and food. Nice place for a date night.
349,NoMI Kitchen,I had a superb experience in this place. We enjoyed the great environment and the meals. The staff were super friendly. I am glad we finally managed to visit this spot.
350,NoMI Kitchen,Beautiful place with live music on Tuesdays and perfect desserts. Check out the Garden!
351,NoMI Kitchen,"Another winner. Came for labor day weekend, stayed at the Hyatt and thought to try this place. The food is a culinary experience, the ambiance is classy and cozy yet casual. Clean, and very good service."
352,NoMI Kitchen,Nice place to go for an after dinner drink. Rooftop seating. Bring a jacket. It can be windy!
353,NoMI Kitchen,"Excellent breakfast, excellent service."
354,NoMI Kitchen,"Upscale lounge and bar that is open late. Nice views, food and drinks to enjoy a late night on the town. Had good vegetarian options as well. Will be back !"
355,NoMI Kitchen,"Weekday after shopping we went and ate in The Garden. Staff was very unpretentious and we were afforded the luxury to linger over cocktails and dishes to share. We had the small charcuterie board and we shared some sushi rolls, a few signature cocktails ‚Äúthe gNoMi ‚Äú yum! Cute as can be in a metallic gnome! Honest! All very good. The rooftop dining was great. The linens and glassware were very elegant with careful details. Plus the location is hard to beat as it is in the Park Hyatt right near Water Tower Place. A few steps from the busy street and a very fresh and relaxing place to talk and unwind."
356,NoMI Kitchen,"My cousin and I are visiting Chicago and were at NoMI lounge a few days ago. The dining area is closed at this time but the lounge is open. We sat with a view of Michigan Ave and enjoyed our drinks and later our dessert. Our wait staff was great, making suggestions when we asked and even taking us to the dining room to get a photo of us with the Water Tower and trees lit up in lights as the back drop. It was a very special evening. We tried several of the drinks and were pleased with each choice as well as the dessert (pictured)."
357,NoMI Kitchen,"Myself and my girlfriend had an absolutely perfect visit to NoMI. From the moment we stepped inside the hotel, the staff was amazing (including the receptionist that answered my silly question). Upon entry to the restaurant, we were greeted by very pleasant hostesses, and later found the waiter named Patrick to be one of the most pleasant people we met in Chicago. The atmosphere is unbelievably welcoming, and the food was delicious. The view from the restaraunt was equally amazing. We highly recommend NoMI."
358,NoMI Kitchen,"We went to this restaurant for Sunday Brunch. The menu offers choices of classical American brunch and sushi or Japanese's cuisine. The restaurant has a great view and both choices of food were simply delicious and sophisticated. The service is impeccable. Definitively a must visit in Chicago! I ate breakfast and two dinners during a recent business trip. The avocado toast is amazing as is the beet juice. For dinner, I enjoyed the scallops one night and the sea bass the second. The service was excellent and added to the experience."
359,NoMI Kitchen,"Where's the option for 10 stars? I took my girlfriend here for a surprise date. The view was amazing, the food was delicious, and the service was top notch. I'll be visiting again. Try the roasted lamb chops."
360,NoMI Kitchen,"Cannot recommend enough. Definitely going to need a reservation if you're looking to sit in the main dining hall, but my family found our own seat in the lounge and had the best sushi I have ever eaten. Open menu for every taste and type. A little bit expensive but absolutely worth the money. Get the sushi platter."
361,NoMI Kitchen,Excellent food and excellent service.
362,NoMI Kitchen,Excellent Food So fresh and tasty Excellent CHEF OUD . ..!!!!üëèüëèüëèüëèüëèüëèüëèüëèüëè Far away the Best sushi place in Chicago We definitely come back soon A Gem in Chicago .!!!
363,NoMI Kitchen,"top 2 favorite places in Chicago. food amazing, view incredible, atmosphere is the best ever. elegant, upscale and classy place for a special occasion. 10/10."
364,NoMI Kitchen,This is my Favorite Sushi Restaurant in Chicago. I also enjoy going to the Spa Before Dinner. A Wonderful Way to end a day in Chicago.
365,NoMI Kitchen,"The restaurant, food and staff made a huge impression on me.  I go to fabulous restaurants on a regular basis, Michelin stars, Top Chef, etc, so food wise, excellent of course.  What was unique was how nice everyone was - i mean everyone went out of their way to be generous, kind, to smile, to make our experience feel like they care for us.  Very welcoming place.  Thank You for being like this... it makes a beautiful statement.  I feel like people working at NoMi are happy.  I will be back.  PS the most awesome breakfast for health nuts like me."
366,NoMI Kitchen,"One of the benefits of dining at NoMI in the Park Hyatt Hotel is you can enjoy the view overlooking Chicago's historic Water Tower while allowing 30 minutes for your delicious dessert, a bitter chocolate souffle with caramel sauce. Located at 800 North Michigan Avenue, on the seventh floor, NoMI (for North Michigan) is one of the city's outstanding restaurants, an elegant dining room with an outdoor garden and French-inspired menu for breakfast, brunch, lunch and dinner. It has earned awards for best service, best hotel bar and best restaurant in Chicago. Chef Eric Damidot draws rave notices for his preparations and presentations."
367,NoMI Kitchen,"A great place for happy hour and lunch. Upscale location. Appetizers - edamame guac dip is delicious. Skip the focaccia, it‚Äôs bread that would be free at other places. Food is ok - have tried the ham sandwich, pretty tasty but not worth 25 dollars. Sushi quality is high and real, fresh fish. Desserts and Drinks - this is where the money is and money is well spend. Macaron  ice cream sandwich is one of the best things I have tasted in a long long time. Drinks are all well done."
368,NoMI Kitchen,Loses star for price for quality of main course.
369,NoMI Kitchen,"Excellent service, beautiful view, wonderful food. 10 out of 10 would recommend!"
370,NoMI Kitchen,Good food. terrace is nice and relaxing
371,NoMI Kitchen,NoMi Kitchen/Garden is very aesthetically pleasing. The garden has a nautical theme with the blue and white. The servers are dressed in white and purple plaid shirts to stick out from the ambiance. It is gorgeous in the garden and almost each table is covered by a mid-sized umbrella to keep you mostly in the shade.
372,NoMI Kitchen,"I wasn't able to get a great photo because it was too sunny out, but for drinks I got the NoMi Mimosas (which had a heavy hand of champagne in them). For food, we ordered the Nomi Platter for $80 that came with 20 pieces of sushi (4 Nigiri, 8 Sashimi and 8 Maki rolls). My favorite part of the platter was the Tiger Maki Roll (shrimp tempura, snow crab, spicy tuna and avocado)."
373,NoMI Kitchen,"The bill for 2 people who ordered the Nomi Platter, 4 drinks and Tiger Roll was about $~200 and then I understood why I received the yelp high roller badge for checking-in here!"
374,NoMI Kitchen,"I recommend definitely visiting as the ambiance and views are beautiful, cocktails tasty and the rolls delicious. I don't recommend getting any of the platters though. Tiger roll is a must!"
375,NoMI Kitchen,"Great food and outstanding service. Burger, Halibut Bouillabaisse, and sushi are all fantastic"
376,NoMI Kitchen,Very good breakfast food and service. Recommend the croissant with potatoes.
377,NoMI Kitchen,We always find ourselves looking for late night spots with amazing dessert & coffee/tea. This was perfect. Great ambiance. Great dessert! That almond joy dessert dish is to die for! I also ordered tea.. which was great. My brother-in-law ordered sushi which was okay (could have been better for the price). But I would still come back.
378,NoMI Kitchen,"Great ambiance, views , food and an extensive wine list."
379,NoMI Kitchen,"Stopped in on a Tuesday. The service was very welcoming and observant. Not so close to my office, unfortunately."
380,NoMI Kitchen,"I'm impressed! The food is delicious, the price is reasonable. The waiter brought me free croissants because I had to wait for my breakfast for too long (actually around 20 minutes while enjoying my cappuccino, which is not a big deal). In the end I asked for check, but he apologized once again and said the breakfast is on them, because of the reason I mentioned above. Just wow!"
381,NoMI Kitchen,It was a classy restaurant with great food varieties. Loved it!
382,NoMI Kitchen,"Magnificent and thoughtful views and ambience! Been coming here a few times a month for well over 10 years now, always leave very happy!"
383,NoMI Kitchen,"Took my date here for her birthday dinner. On making the reservation I just asked for a nice table to mark the occasion. We were seated in a perfect spot, beautiful city view. Food was absolutely phenomenal, service was spot on and quick from water to food to check. They had a surprise for her at the evening, a beautiful dessert on the house for her birthday. Thank you for making the occasion so wonderful for her. Highly, highly recommend Nomi!"
384,NoMI Kitchen,Great rooftop patio. Friendly and accommodating staff. Excellent cocktail menu and great food. The views both inside the main dining room and from the outdoor patio are awesome. A great place for a meal or just cocktails and a view.
385,NoMI Kitchen,"Great place near the water tower (nice landscape).  An excellent cocktail, nice service and very good food."
386,NoMI Kitchen,"Great ambiance - felt like a lounge more than a restaurant. The sashimi was pretty good. On the pricier side and decently fresh. Would not be my top sashimi restaurant, but for the convenience, it was worth it."
387,NoMI Kitchen,"The best experience for breakfast in Chicago, I highly recommend to anyone who wants a good time."
388,NoMI Kitchen,We came in for after dinner drinks and got the last two seats at the window. Our view was of the Water Tower just as it started to snow. We are high school sweet hearts who never got married . We celebrate our first date as our anniversary. Omar came over to check on us and we told him our story. We were having a great evening reminiscing the years when a beautiful little dessert arrived. We weren't expecting anything which made it all the more special. Thank you Omar for making us feel special on our special night .
389,NoMI Kitchen,"Awesome place:  Perfect service, great food, excellent wine selection, and - if available - tables with a great view.  Good for unhurried and enjoyable small or medium-sized group dinner."
390,NoMI Kitchen,"There's hardly ever anything to complain about when coming here to dine. I've come here almost every year for Restaurant Week brunch since I can remember. It's a lovely place, phenomenal food, great view and above all else, decent pricing. I've never tried dinner so I can't say that it's amazing for that as well, but eventually, I'll give dinner a whirl."
391,NoMI Kitchen,"Got there about one, it wasn't busy. The staff was helpful and kind."
392,NoMI Kitchen,"Food was tasty, great wine selection and the service was fantastic. Jay was one of the employees with I was working with and he was just great. The downside was the size of the portions. They were small which made the food seem a bit over priced.  I did not feel especially full after bread, oysters, crab linguine and a side dish. Lastly, the bar area was very inviting and relaxing. If nothing else, I will come back to enjoy a seat in the bar. With the price paid compared to what I received, I am not sure if I will 'insist' on coming back to the restaurant. A pleasant experience overall though."
393,NoMI Kitchen,"The atmosphere, menu selection, wines and overall setting is totally Awesome. Love the Rooftop‚Ä¶"
394,NoMI Kitchen,"Great food, great service, beautiful views!"
395,NoMI Kitchen,"LOVE THIS PLACE, from the view, to the sushi, to the staff, it's a wonderful place for lunch and dinner.  The food is so fresh and tasty-they don't mess around here.  They also have a gorgeous room for a private dinner with your closest friends and family (all it takes is $$).  Expensive but worth it for what you're getting.  Did I mention the view is incredible, looking right down onto Mich Ave and the park???"
396,NoMI Kitchen,"Love the whole feel of this restaurant that's perched overlooking the Water Tower and Michigan Ave. Sit in the lounge until you can get a window seat for dinner. Servings are on the small side but very good. Sushi is fresh, wine list is good, service is phenomenal. There for a birthday and desert was free for everyone. It's expensive but well worth the experience."
397,NoMI Kitchen,Very nice spot to go for dinner. The sushi is fantastic and all of the small plates were terrific! Would highly recommend!
398,NoMI Kitchen,"World-class food, not-insane prices for the quality. Couldn't recommend more."
399,NoMI Kitchen,"Sat at the lounge area prior to the restaurant opening for the evening... The location and view requires booking ahead for a pleasant experience.... Sushi rolls and octopus salad were really flavorful and good, lounge seating is quite memorable and comfortable‚Ä¶"
400,NoMI Kitchen,Great view and food. Book through open table!
401,NoMI Kitchen,"The best at the Nomi is the terrace (no reservation accepted; first come first serve basis). If it's too cold, ask to be seated in one of the table close to the high windows. Staff is very friendly (one of them found for us sun glasses!). Food is good and wine is OK."
402,NoMI Kitchen,Beautiful views and the service is excellent. Great place to relax and have a bite to eat and get away from the loudness of the city. Food is very nicely prepared and presented. Highly recommend!
403,NoMI Kitchen,"Superb seafood, sushi, and amazing assistance. Great for Mother‚Äôs Day."
404,NoMI Kitchen,Near perfect in every conceivable way. World renowned chef's frequent the establishment. Exceptional decor and an experienced Sommelier. Breathtaking views and private dining. Food is unparalleled. A must visit. Expensive and worth every penny.
405,NoMI Kitchen,"A little more pricey than the typical dinner spot, but the location and service are worth it. The service is really a hit or miss, but the food is always delicious. Nomi has a good menu and fine wine selection, but Nomi fails to create its own identity.   Look, you gotta pay to play.  Are there other restaurants in the city where you can get a respectable bite for half the cost?  Certainly.  But at NoMi, you are eating where restaurant critics come on their night off.  This place is a great dining experience for a very special occasion.  Make sure to ask for a window view."
406,NoMI Kitchen,"Tried this restaurant for the first time during Chicago Restaurant Week. The view of Michigan Avenue along made the lunch fun, and the food was spectacular. Inventive. Original. Comforting. A great hideaway to relax and refuel after a shopping excursion."
407,NoMI Kitchen,We went there for a friend's birthday. It's got a nice view of the city and an open kitchen. The food was delicious and in surprisingly big portions. We were stuffed and got complimentary free dessert in the end.
408,NoMI Kitchen,Beautiful view and food was delicious
409,NoMI Kitchen,"got there about one, it wasn't busy. looking forward to coming back with my relatives."
410,NoMI Kitchen,I went expecting the same level of dining that they had two plus years ago to find that they have changed to a contemporary and less expensive experience.  The sushi was fair but not very special and the menu looked very standard.  The best thing about the restaurant was the view of lake Michigan over the Museum of Contemporary Art.
411,NoMI Kitchen,"An incredible and one of a kind experience. Food was truly special, service outstanding, wine experience w/ pairings from the sommelier were thoughtful and unique. The attention to detail throughout the experience was unparalleled. View is the best in the city. I will come back anytime I want a special dinner or have people I want to impress!"
412,NoMI Kitchen,"In Chicago for a couple of days and heard Nomi was a must for dinner.  As a jaded New Yorker I was first greeted in the lobby by a massive Robert Rauschenberg Art Work which set the tone for the rest of the evening.  The restaurant is elegant on every level from furnishings, lighting, staff and chinaware to the cloth dinner napkins (thank god they weren't standard white, the pattern matched their carpeting). If you are looking for a romantic evening or a place where you can get dressed up and have an elegant experience I would suggest Nomi."
413,NoMI Kitchen,Good food in a relaxed atmosphere.
414,NoMI Kitchen,Outstanding chicken caesars salad - croutons were incredible!
415,Rosebud on Rush,It has a lovely outdoor seating.
416,Rosebud on Rush,"This is a 4 star, kid-friendly place specialized in Italian which also serves alcohol."
417,Rosebud on Rush,"Amazingness! Jerry Thank you for treating our family so well. The entire staff was great but Jerry took the cake, kind and super attentive. We loved the food with the cooks exquisite display of culinary pasi√≥n. Wine selection was quite impressive and extensive we appreciated that. Vegan friendly as we are on a newly recent vegan transition. We sat on the patio this time but futuristically we hope to dine inside. This place is definitely a Chicago staple within the community, traffic here is busy. There is a secure parking deck w/valet directly across the street, street parking too!"
418,Rosebud on Rush,"Even though parking downtown costs more than dinner, it was fantastic as always!  The chicken parmesan was  spectacular and the eggplant stack was out of this world!  Service was impeccable. Great way to spend a warm summer evening... high recommended."
419,Rosebud on Rush,"The service and food are excellent, highly recommended"
420,Rosebud on Rush,Best food best service our server Jerry is the best. ‚úåÔ∏èüëçüòÑüò∑
421,Rosebud on Rush,Would avoid during covid. Great restaurant but they are not complying to social distancing and their outdoor patio is packed with all tables being a couple feet from the next table.  There are safer restaurants in river north during this time.
422,Rosebud on Rush,"Amazingness! Jerry Thank you for treating our family so well. The entire staff was great but Jerry took the cake, kind and super attentive.

423,Rosebud on Rush,"Congratulations to Rosebud for being a shining beacon in the midst of a pandemic! For people visiting Chicago for a day in late June ‚Äò20, you guys were a shining oasis in the desert! It appears that all the 5-star hotels in the city are closed at the moment, but you guys are still good for snipes of Mo√´t et Chandon! We had a tasty early lunch, as an accompaniment to the Champagne. The only downside was the leathery bread for the bruschetta. Everything else was excellent. Which is why you guys still deserve 5 stars in such challenging times. Keep up the good work!"
424,Rosebud on Rush,"Rosebud is always incredible and remains our favorite spot in Chicago! The food is spectacular, particularly the chicken parmesan and the ziti. The staff is so attentive and kind. Our waiter, Francisco, went above and beyond to make sure we had a perfect experience dining in the heated patio on Christmas Eve . We can‚Äôt wait to come back!"
425,Rosebud on Rush,"Everything on this menu looked incredible, but I got the eggplant in tomato sauce and cheese, and the rigatoni pasta with burrata cheese. Finished my meal off with a strawberry sorbet and vanilla gelato swirl, and I was one happy camper. I highly recommend coming to Rosebud on Rush for an incredible Italian meal."
426,Rosebud on Rush,"Even though parking downtown costs more than dinner, it was fantastic as always!  The chicken parmesan was  spectacular and the eggplant stack was out of this world!  Service was impeccable. Great way to spend a warm summer evening... high recommended."
427,Rosebud on Rush,"Atmosphere: Busy, elegant"
428,Rosebud on Rush,"Service: Welcoming, doting"
429,Rosebud on Rush,"Food: Be careful not to fill up on the bread, its divine. Rigatoni with Vodka Sauce was perfect, especially with the addition of a meatball. Chicken Picatta was basic, but flavorful. Eggplant Parmesan was perfect, tender rich and robust. Sauteed spinach was a great accompaniment."
430,Rosebud on Rush,Pricing: Above entrees were approx $29 each
431,Rosebud on Rush,"Fantastic food with a great atmosphere! ""Thats a spicy meatball!"""
432,Rosebud on Rush,The staff went out of their way to get us a seat. Phenomenal service and great wine.
433,Rosebud on Rush,Service is amazing!!! We came for my birthday on a rainy Monday and seated on the patio with a last minute reservation. The food was delicious and our server Adan was so attentive and made sure we were enjoying our time I can‚Äôt wait to come back again! Thank you for the wonderful birthday :)
434,Rosebud on Rush,"Perfect, classic Italian with an old school feel!"
435,Rosebud on Rush,One of my all time favorites! Never disappoints! If your in Chicago definitely a must have
436,Rosebud on Rush,Best rigatoni alla vodka üíØ Portion sizes are huge also! Favorite Sunday meal
437,Rosebud on Rush,High quality food and service.. High quality prices too
438,Rosebud on Rush,"Good food. Excellent service by the staff. They were courteous, attentive, and timely. Highly recommend."
439,Rosebud on Rush,"Best eggplant parmigiana I have ever had! So thin and delicious, it was like it was filled with air! Portions are very large so prepare to have takeout. It‚Äôs a bit pricey but well worth it. Service was great and charming location especially sitting outside on the patio. Well done!"
440,Rosebud on Rush,One of my fav locations for Italian food. The service was very friendly and kind. The bill was reasonable.
441,Rosebud on Rush,One of my fav places for quality Italian food. Staff treated us so nice. It has a cool atmosphere.
442,Rosebud on Rush,Nice place for Lunch or dinner.
443,Rosebud on Rush,So delicious! The chicken picatta is amazing and they make a great old fashioned.
444,Rosebud on Rush,"Food was fabulous, outdoor seating was warm and cozy."
445,Rosebud on Rush,"I went here for Valentine‚Äôs Day and the service was amazing. Their prices are reasonable, and their portions sizes are hefty. I only ate half of it before taking it home. The Chicken Parmesan was extremely soft and juicy. They had heart balloons all around the restaurant and the vibe was homey but professional. I will definitely be visiting again!"
446,Rosebud on Rush,"Had the mussels in garlic white wine sauce, house salad with a homemade peppercorn ranch dressing and the Fruita diMare!!! Chef Francisco personally brought it out. I highly recommend Rosebud on Rush and will definitely return!!!"
447,Rosebud on Rush,Good food and great service! We shared penne vodka and had a couple of drinks. Staff was friendly. Pasta was yummy and a good portion for the two of us.
448,Rosebud on Rush,"It is a great location. Waiters are friendly and competent. The food is always perfect, I recommend the eggplant parmesan, it is succulent. It is a good idea to make a reservation, or the wait can be pretty long."
449,Rosebud on Rush,"4 stars for the great lunch special ($9.95), nice seating, romantic cellar ambience, friendly service, above par quality food, decent and for lunch spe ial flavorful and filling, thank you"
450,Rosebud on Rush,I came here for the first time and ordered the Cavatelli on a recommendation and was not disappointed! It was one of my favorite Italian dishes I‚Äôve ever tried. The bread was fresh and hot and we had chocolate cake afterwards that was massive and delicious. The service was friendly and fast. The music was also amazing. Please come here!
451,Rosebud on Rush,"The food there was very good!  I had the chicken club and it was delicious!!  As soon as you walk in you get this authentic Italian vibe.  I loved that they were playing old jazz such as Ella Fitzgerald, Louis Armstrong, Frank Sinatra."
452,Rosebud on Rush,Very nice restaurant cozy delicious food
453,Rosebud on Rush,Brunch was wonderful had the greek omellete delicious...staff was friendly.. i have a melon allergy they replaced the fruit with berries unneccesary but very appreciative...most definetely would come again..like tomorrow :)

455,Rosebud on Rush,"This was our breakfast. Is really huge size, good taste and worth its value. Nice environment and will surely visit again."
456,Rosebud on Rush,"Excellent food. Generous portions, especially the desserts. Wait staff very helpful and friendly. Upstairs main dining area did become noisy at times, but that just means everyone was enjoying themselves."
457,Rosebud on Rush,My son bought me here for my birthday. It was absolutely great. Italian food
458,Rosebud on Rush,"Good portion, great music and a good place to go for a romantic date"
459,Rosebud on Rush,Always a great italian classic! Great food and service!
460,Rosebud on Rush,"Went here for lunch while on a business trip.  Great food!  I had the spaghetti & meatball.  My wife had the cheese ravioli.  So delicious and ""authentic"".  I grew up on the east coast eating a lot of good Italian food both in restaurants and homemade by family.  The food here is the real deal.  The test for me at a restaurant is always the meatball.  This meatball was huge but moist, dense & delicious.  The ravioli melted in your mouth and were equally delicious.  With so many Italian restaurant choices in the area, so glad we went here.  We also liked the location and fact that the restaurant is an old brownstone.  Prices were around $20 a dish for lunch."
461,Rosebud on Rush,"Great food, good location.Very clean and we love going there as a family. Owner is on hands on rvery detail. We love their steaks, Alfredo chicken fettucine, tiramisu and salads."
462,Rosebud on Rush,My favorite Chicago restaurant. An Italian restaurant with great atmosphere and food
463,Rosebud on Rush,"One of my favorite italian places in the heart of Chicago. Directly across the street from Giordano's, I find the food much better here. The staff is excellent, and each dish is wonderfully crafted. I had the spicy calamari for a starter and the Sunday special, ""Grandma's Gravy"". The special was amazing, the braised beef in it melted in your mouth. Make sure to make reservations on the weekends or busy downtown nights."
464,Rosebud on Rush,"Lovely little brunch place. Great atmosphere, service was phenomenal. Food was cooked well with fresh ingredients. Seasoning was light to let the fresh ingredients shine. Definitely worth checking out."
465,Rosebud on Rush,"Delicious food, fantastic atmosphere. Meatballs are to die for! Had the skirt steak salad, will definitely be stopping again in future visits to Chicago."
466,Rosebud on Rush,"a little pricey with some dishes better than others. had the rosebud parpedelle (kinda bland), fettuccine (also bland), eggplant parmesan (ok), and seafood pasta (excellent with nice char flavor). seems like a lot of celebrities love this place. staff is friendly."
467,Rosebud on Rush,"Split a ribeye and spaghetti with a coworker. Service was fantastic and staff was very accommodating.  We went to a couple other restaurants that had hour and a half waits, Rosebud on Rush got us in right away and the food was phenomenal.  Great atmosphere and old school vibe!"
468,Rosebud on Rush,Best food best service our server Jerry is the best. ‚úåÔ∏èüëçüòÑüò∑
469,Rosebud on Rush,Best food and service ever...I will be back the next time I am in Chi-town
470,Rosebud on Rush,Always good.  I like to sit at the bar.  Highly recommend the spaghetti with Bolognese sauce.  It's a custom order and delicious.
471,Rosebud on Rush,Service is always good.
472,Rosebud on Rush,I return regularly
473,Rosebud on Rush,"Great food and wine. Attentive, polite and friendly staff."
474,Rosebud on Rush,I loved the Arribiatta sauce. A little zing for sure! I think I would have like this possibly with some mushrooms or something but the pasta and sauce were greatness.
475,Rosebud on Rush,"Loved the food. I eated really well, there were big rations of food and it tasted excellent. I recommend spaghetti with meatballs, it was delicious and the meatballs were unique, big and good."
476,Rosebud on Rush,"I have visited Chicago twice and have been to Rosebud on Rush both times! It was by far my favorite Italian cuisine compared to the other three I ate at during my visits. Super tasty, great wine selection, and an extremely kind staff. Quality of the food is fantastic, and I recommend this place to all my closest friends!"
477,Rosebud on Rush,"Made a reservation via Open Table, which was good because it was very crowded. The food was excellent and the portions are enormous! I had lobster ravioli with tomatoes and asparagus and he had chicken parmesan; neither of us could finish our meals."
478,Rosebud on Rush,"The wine list is exceptional as well. By the glass or the bottle, there were a ton of choices."
479,Rosebud on Rush,"Yummy!  Had the antipasto,  calamari, and caesar salad.  Then a seafood pasta special,  veal, and a spicy pasta dish.  Everything was delicious,  though I was disappointed in the veal, tough and would have been better over pasta.  5 people shared the dishes and it was more than enough."
480,Rosebud on Rush,"There were 14 of us for dinner. The portions were very generous, I‚Äôd recommend splitting! The service was great. Food was amazing. We had a great time."
481,Rosebud on Rush,The Best! Delicious and Awesome! The price is right... Excellent Customer Service. Best Italian food!
482,Rosebud on Rush,Excellent service and food would highly recommend
483,Rosebud on Rush,Amazing food .. sat at the bar with john.. he guided me thru the menu and the portion size are amazing.. if u r reading this please go.. u will thank me after.. i had the chicken parmesan but saw some many plates come out and that where john helped..great plate presentation..
484,Rosebud on Rush,"The service and food are excellent, highly recommended"
485,Rosebud on Rush,Amazing and Chicago famous Italian cuisine. A must try. Good seafood selection.
486,Rosebud on Rush,Love the fettuccine alfredo with salmon.
487,Rosebud on Rush,Came here yesterday with my family at around 9. The waiter Ben was really nice and friendly. I got the Fettuccine Alfredo and it was so good! The pasta was cooked perfectly and the sauce was deliciousssss. Very authentic I highly recommend!
488,Rosebud on Rush,"Sad to see Mama Boys gone but happy to get some great Italian in Chicago, personal service with personality is always the best."
489,Rosebud on Rush,"This place is truly a gem. Great location with very nice outdoor seating. Great food with traditional Italian favorites as well as some more inventive menu items. Best of all, the service is warm and exceptional - highlighted by the manager who is one of the most gracious and gentlemanly service people I can recall meeting."
490,Rosebud on Rush,"Fantastic service. We knew from before that the portions are enormous, so we asked to have them split. The staff was accommodating and the food was great!"
491,Rosebud on Rush,"Came here at lunch time and asked if they could make this from dinner menu, and they made it!! It is reeeeeeeeelly good! Have it! Very creamy and soft, yummy!"
492,Rosebud on Rush,Very filling though lol.
493,Rosebud on Rush,Pleasant outdoor dining good food good service
494,Rosebud on Rush,"Good place with a calm atmosphere. Came here with a colleague from work and ordered the shrimp and broccoli pasta. Wasn't a great combo in my opinion. My friend got a steak; I made a poor decision. Other than that, it would be great to have faster service; the resto was understaffed."
495,Rosebud on Rush,"loved it more 10 years ago, but still a good enough red sauce joint when you're downtown and craving big portions of Italian food"
496,Rosebud on Rush,"I come here every time I‚Äôm in Chicago. Try the eggplant stack.  Generous portions, everything I‚Äôve had is delicious. I recommend reservations."
497,Rosebud on Rush,"Quesadillas are the best!!! Food is great. Service could be better but wasn't terrible,  they were really busy. Food makes it worth it!"
498,Rosebud on Rush,It was busy and there was about a 10 min wait.  Had veal marsala and my son had ravioli.  They were both good.  The stuffed mushrooms were also very good.
499,Rosebud on Rush,Nice clean Italian food. Lasagna was excellent. Great Manhattan. Wait staff was top notch.
500,Rosebud on Rush,Great food.  Great service.  We're shared a dinner and a salad and had plenty to eat.  4th time there.  I can't wait to return.
501,Rosebud on Rush,"The atmosphere is fun, waiters are great, and food is terrific. This last visit we met up with friends from DC who were also attending the meetings we were attending in town. They had asked the night before, ""We would like some excellent Italian food."" I knew just the place. Have been coming to this restaurant for 2 decades--often just before the opera at the divine Chicago Lyric. However, as we age and hearing aids are a necessity, we noticed the noise level a wee bit more than usual. Who cares--the food is great."
502,Rosebud on Rush,Fresh crusty bread
503,Rosebud on Rush,Stopped by late afternoon for a mozzarella and tomato salad. My partner had the minestrone soup and huge side salad. Just enough!
504,Rosebud on Rush,"Honestly, Rosebud is a winner and should be part of any visit to the Windy City. Love the service, the location and the food is phenomenal. Been there several times with groups and everyone at the table always has been very chapped about their orders. Highly recommend."
505,Rosebud on Rush,"I've been to the Rosebud on Rush twice now. Once for NYE, and another just to celebrate a special occasion. They've impressed me every time. The food here is incredible. If they have it, get the special Chilean Sea Bass."
506,Rosebud on Rush,"Great, old style Italian food with excellent service from the front door all the way through dessert. Would recommend this restaurant to all visiting downtown Chicago and will make this a must visit on our return trips."
507,Rosebud on Rush,"One of the best Italian restaurants I visit during my travels. I always make it a point to stop here. I have also entertained many people here, and they always love it. The calamari is some of the best I have ever had. It is very lightly fried and they serve you large pieces. The pasta is extraordinary. My favorite dish is the Pappardelle Pasta with the tomato basil sauce.  Be sure you go hungry, the portions are large.  The only negative is that the place can get very  cramped inside, but I promise that the wait and the crowds are well worth it."
508,Rosebud on Rush,"Fantastic and flavorful food, I love the ambience this place has, and the cashiers were friendly. Will definitely come back again."
509,Rosebud on Rush,"Truly a lovely evening. We sat downstairs, cozy, festive with Christmas decor. Fabulous, attentive service. We ate two of the specials, a veal chop, on bone, Parmigiana -style and red pepper asparagus risotto with veal medallions. All cooked to perfection. Generous portions. (We will be having veal chop for lunch today!) Excellent wine list, wonderful sommelier. And to top it off, the best Tiramisu I've had, and I've had it all over the world."
510,Rosebud on Rush,"My colleagues went to downtown Chicago near the Miracle Mile for dinner on a Tuesday night. This restaurant came highly recommended as authentic Italian cuisine and an authentic Italian-style dining experience. They weren't wrong. The restaurant wasn't packed but it was busy. It was noisy to the point that we didn't know there was music playing until most of the other tables left. That wasn't a bad thing and 7 of us certainly added to it. The dining room is somewhat dark with low ceilings and heavy wood posts.All the servers were men, besides the sommelier. In other words, the quintessential Italian restaurant feel."
511,Rosebud on Rush,"Visiting from out of town and found this place a few steps from my hotel - Magnificent Mile area. Food, service and ambiance fantastic! Definitely will be back next time I'm in Chicago."
512,Rosebud on Rush,"The best Italian food I've had in Chicago, so far."
513,Rosebud on Rush,"The breakfast is phenomenal. I'm not from Chicago, but my husband and I travel to Chicago every three months and before we head home, we stop by for breakfast. We've also dined here for lunch and thre chicken parmesan was great. I'm a picky eater and hard to please, but Rosebud Rush has not disappointed me. Also their waiters are nice and courteous."
514,Rosebud on Rush,"Steven our waiter was great, cozy place on rainy afternoon..Delicious homemade pasta."
515,Rosebud on Rush,Loved it!  Actually always.  I've been coming here for 20+ years and have never had a bad experience!!
516,Rosebud on Rush,Best Chicken Parmigiana I have ever had. To think we walked past this restaurant for five years. Rosebud will definitely be on our must stops for dinners on future trips!
517,Rosebud on Rush,"Great Italian restaurant, affordable price and great menu selection"
518,Rosebud on Rush,"We shared several different entree's as family style. The food here is delicious! The pasta is second to none.  I left here feeling so full i needed a nap!  Again, they were so busy, our waiter took much longer to grab us drinks but the food is unquestionably delicious. I will be returning here again!"
519,Rosebud on Rush,Had a wonderful birthday dinner  here.  Food was superb. Everything was fresh and flavorful .
520,Rosebud on Rush,Great open concept outside. I live the Milanese is so delicious.
521,The Grill On The Alley,"This is a 4 star, kid-friendly place for American food, seafood and steaks which also serves alcohol."
522,The Grill On The Alley,"It is a wonderful dining experience! Very outstanding in every aspect.  Every staff member who interacted with me was knowledgeable, attentive, and passionate. The best food and hospitality I have ever had. This place really made it a great night for me. I can't wait to come back here. Thank you very much and keep up the good work always."
523,The Grill On The Alley,"Great experience tonight, had a slight mishap (no fault of the restaurant) and they went above and beyond in customer service. Jake or Jacob, the server was excellent, very professional and attentive despite being busy and having a few needy customers. Thank you all for the amazing food and service and for staying open."
524,The Grill On The Alley,"Overall, the food is good and cooked well. The mistake we made was we ordered the tomahawk steak which was underwhelming in terms of quantity. Next time, we'll order something else."
525,The Grill On The Alley,Visited The Grill to celebrate the birthday of my wife.  Attended with a best friend and his wife who also share the same birthday.  Very disappointed.  Both my steak and that of my friend were prepared wrong.  I order medium well.  It arrived medium rare.  My friend ordered medium rare.  His arrived medium well.  My friend asked to have his stake re-fired.  They did.  I should have sent mine back.  I chose not to do so.  These guys were not busy.  They were not ready for prime time.  Will never go again.
526,The Grill On The Alley,"Good food, great cocktails and incredible service! We'll definitely come back again."
527,The Grill On The Alley,"Very outstanding in every aspect.  Every staff member who interacted with me was knowledgeable, attentive, and passionate. The best food and hospitality I have ever had. This place really made it a great night for me. I can't wait to come back here. Thank you very much and keep up the good work always."
528,The Grill On The Alley,The dishes were creative and fun. The wine pairing was outstanding. The service was excellent because the staff members are quick to respond to our request. The chef even came out to greet our table. We're very much happy with our experience here. Thank you so much! Highly recommended!
529,The Grill On The Alley,Husband picked this spot and was so good! Got there right at 6 and they offered the happy hour price of calamari to us. Was really good and seasoned well. Hubby ordered rack of lamb with lobster bisque and I ordered ribeye with fries. Both cooked well. Steak was seasoned just the way I like it and a perfect medium rare to rare like requested.  Never tried lobster bisque and it was oh so good!! Bottle of Malbec for $52- not too bad! Love me a great Malbec and ribeye and this hit the spot! Will definitely come back. Yumm
530,The Grill On The Alley,"It is a wonderful dining experience! Very outstanding in every aspect.  Every staff member who interacted with me was knowledgeable, attentive, and passionate. The best food and hospitality I have ever had. This place really made it a great night for me. I can't wait to come back here. Thank you very much and keep up the good work always."
531,The Grill On The Alley,"I came here on a business trip with a friend due to it being one of the only places available for sit down that is open during the COIVD crisis. Our server was professional and you can expect a fine dining atmosphere. The food was delicious, prepared well, and they definitely care about the look with beautiful orientation and each plate wiped clean before being served. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone who is not budget conscious since it is on the pricer side."
532,The Grill On The Alley,"Great experience tonight, had a slight mishap (no fault of the restaurant) and they went above and beyond in customer service. Jake or Jacob, the server was excellent, very professional and attentive despite being busy and having a few needy customers. Thank you all for the amazing food and service and for staying open."
533,The Grill On The Alley,"Overall, the food is good and cooked well. The mistake we made was we ordered the tomahawk steak which was underwhelming in terms of quantity. Next time, we'll order something else."
534,The Grill On The Alley,"Wonderful place to treat your family. Food was tremendous! For service, this is a place to take your time and enjoy your company. Will be back!"
535,The Grill On The Alley,Visited The Grill to celebrate the birthday of my wife.  Attended with a best friend and his wife who also share the same birthday.  Very disappointed.  Both my steak and that of my friend were prepared wrong.  I order medium well.  It arrived medium rare.  My friend ordered medium rare.  His arrived medium well.  My friend asked to have his stake re-fired.  They did.  I should have sent mine back.  I chose not to do so.  These guys were not busy.  They were not ready for prime time.  Will never go again.
536,The Grill On The Alley,"Best NY steak on the planet. Of all the great cuts on the menu, the dry aged version with umami butter is the best. Nothing else quite like it. The seafood tower is great as well and a perfect appetizer for groups of four or more."
537,The Grill On The Alley,"Excellent steak and service! This is a great place to a business or special moment dinner. The service is fantastic, the steaks are out of this world. Excellent selection of wine and bourbons (to me, a must‚Äîto prove a point, they had ‚ÄúThe Prisoner‚Äù wine and Blanton‚Äôs for the bourbon!). The salads, the vegetables were also perfect."
538,The Grill On The Alley,"Unforgettable, Outstanding experience. The Grill On The Alley service and atmosphere given by the staff was perfect and high quality."
539,The Grill On The Alley,Definitely will not go back messed up reservations food was cold
540,The Grill On The Alley,"I've had a great experience here multiple times. I find the staff is always so friendly. One thing that impressed me most was an instance where my steak was overcooked. Upon delivering the steak, my server asked me to cut into it confirm it was cooked to my liking. Before I could even get the words out of my mouth, he had removed the plate from the table and was walking away. He returned minutes later with a steak cooked perfectly. This is a compliment to their recovery, not a dig for overcooking the steak"
541,The Grill On The Alley,We returned for lunch in the Grill. Service is quite good.  We were well greeted and given a table at the primary dining area.I liked their ahi tuna salad very great salad.  I'd mashed potatoes with it.  My husband loved his sliders with chips.  Its a very wonderful restaurant at the downtown San Jose area.
542,The Grill On The Alley,Both lobster bisque and steak were little salty for me but overall great food and nice that they were served hot! The server was very nice too! Fyi you get nothing else than steak so you need to order side for extra
543,The Grill On The Alley,I don't dish out five stars easily.  I've eaten hear three to four times and every time has been as good as the last.  Quintessential 'old-school' steak house with impeccable service and comparable prices.  Would recommend to anyone; one of the best of San Jose.
544,The Grill On The Alley,The lobstar and creamed spinich were really nice. However too much waiting.
545,The Grill On The Alley,"The grill on the alley is a nice hidden gem. The grill on the alley is located off of San Felipe Rd in the Evergreen area. I went there for brunch and was seated immediately. The staff was very friendly and attentive. They have a good variety of food with great mimosas., the food comes out pretty quick so there are no long wait. I ordered the spinach omelette with hash browns, it was amazing and filling. The restaurant has three flat screen tv for entertainment as you wait which is not very long. It does get a little loud because the ceiling is high up but it is bearable. The Grill on the Alley is a great restaurant with friendly Star. Highly recommended."
546,The Grill On The Alley,"Before watching Miss Saigon at SJ Center of the Performing Arts, we had dinner here on a Friday night. Wow! It's so different than what I remembered years ago! I didn't know it was so fancy! Maybe cuz we just dressed up that night for the show? The restaurant  has ""The Great Gatsby"" feel to it. Kind of like a place where Jay Gatsby has one of his elaborate parties and you get drawn into the captivating world of the wealthy, and then you become a witness to illusions and deceits. Yeah. That's the vibe I got from this place! I guess I didn't really go into the restaurant a few years ago, just the bar area for happy hour. Even though the service was slow (and we were kind of in a hurry to see the show), the food was pretty good. We started with the Cast Iron Mediterranean Mussels, tasty with garlic and herbs. We then had the Wagyu Beef Carpaccio, deliciously raw when drizzled with lemon, and nicely served with arugula. The Lobster Bisque was next. The slightly sweet crema helped us warm up since it was cold that night. They divided the Seared Diver Scallops so that we had our own plates. It was my favorite dish of the night, and the sweet corn puree with the other veggies served with the scallops were a nice treat! Our last dish was the Brussel Sprouts. Although it was the least favorite dish of the night, I still liked it with the small pieces of bacon. I was so full by then! I enjoyed my wine with my dinner, called FreakShow. You have to order a drink with a name like that! I can't tell you much about it, but it was a smooth red blend, and it reminded me of dark chocolate."
547,The Grill On The Alley,"Like I mentioned before, service was slow, we had to remind our server that we had a show to catch. We didn't have time for dessert, but we were full anyway. We didn't have room in our bellies for something sweet. There was also time when we already had the dish, and another server brought the same dish. Miscommunication, perhaps?!? I almost gave this place 3 stars, but I guess I was drawn into its lavish world of decadence kind of vibe, just like The Great Gatsby. Sigh. Watch out, though! It might also be where obsession, madness, and tragedy await."
548,The Grill On The Alley,Very neat and accessible restaurant. They provide large portions and for economical prices. We liked the meals very much and the staff members were very affable and explanatory. Highly recommended.
549,The Grill On The Alley,"Our favorite steakhouse in San Jose. Might seem pricey, but the portions are great and the steaks are mouthwatering. Steak tartar is absolutely amazing!"
550,The Grill On The Alley,"Dining experience was great. Wonderful service, excellent food. Just be prepared to drop some serious cash."
551,The Grill On The Alley,My wife and I first went here for a company Christmas party and we loved it. It is now one of our favorite restaurant. The service and food are always great.
552,The Grill On The Alley,"Awesome service and great food.  The booth we in which we were first seated needed some repair,  so they had to re-seat us.  Steaks were cooked perfect to our liking.  They have a nice drink and wine selection to go with your meal. We would go often if we had deep pockets, as dinner was pricey. Food and service was worth it, though."
553,The Grill On The Alley,"So, I'm sure this place is exactly what someone is looking for. My in-laws sighed with delight upon entering, because the atmosphere has all the white tablecloth gravitas of a dinner out on Mad Men, but entirely stripped of anything that might smack of vintage charm. The food is all technically correct and exactly meets expectations for food of this type, without any surprises or deviation from the mold. You will like it here if you value quality and predictability, and abhor anything quirky or unexpected. If you are a lonely tech gentlemen in town on business, and you want to eat a steak and drink a glass of red wine while gazing into your iPad without feeling strange about sitting alone, they have a secluded corner for you. Bring your sweater, because the air conditioner is cranked way up, adding to the air of sterility. And bring a lot of money, because it ain't cheap. The creamed spinach is tasty, though."
554,The Grill On The Alley,Service was lousy and food was served cold. Manager was apologetic and knocked $100 off the price of a $350 tab. We won't be back.
555,The Grill On The Alley,"Have been in the restaurant twice.  Both times we were celebrating with our son and his wife.  We are from San Clemente and ask them where they would like to celebrate.  This has been their choice for food, atmosphere and service.  The steaks are excellent and the wine list is quite good. This restaurant is in The Fairmont Hotel and it had an orchestra in the area outside the restaurant on the Saturday night we were there.  People were dancing and it was fun to be there.  Highly recommend the dining experience and location."
556,The Grill On The Alley,"Friendly service, good happy hour. Bar recently remodeled. Nice decor although, the old bar had more character."
557,The Grill On The Alley,"Great food, staff very friendly and provides great and reliable service. Hours start from 5pm, perhaps literally with an entrance from inside the Fairmont Hotel they should consider opening earlier than 5pm to give more choices of places to eat for guest. Even a bar service with food would be welcomed."
558,The Grill On The Alley,"Instead of 5 stars I gave them 4. We were in on 12/21/17 for lunch with customer and coworkers and they ran out of Salmon so I choose steak but then after steak, finishing glass of wine and I cant get my expresso. They ran out expresso again...What a day here? Next time I will loan my Jura coffee maker machine."
559,The Grill On The Alley,"Everything we had for dinner we really enjoyed. We started with the tuna tataki and it was so good. The fish was so fresh and the sauce that came with it had great flavor. My husband got the cod for dinner and really enjoyed it. I got the tuna tower, which was amazing. The tuna was just so fresh and it was a large portion for an appetizer. I would definitely recommend this restaurant."
560,The Grill On The Alley,Decent food. Good ambiance. Ok service. Food average. Will look for alternative next time I'm in San Jose.
561,The Grill On The Alley,Food was not worth the price. The server forgot a vegetable order. The caesar salad was nothing special. We probably won't go again
562,The Grill On The Alley,Options for indian taste were quite limited. Also it was quite a costly place.
563,The Grill On The Alley,"The ambiance of this place is like an old school upscale steakhouse, with rich woods abounding and moderate lighting. The food was fantastic; my steak was perfectly cooked and the broccoli was perfect. Wine pairing was helpfully suggested. It's pricey, but it's definitely worth it. Will visit again if I get the opportunity."
564,The Grill On The Alley,"This is a solid 3.5 stars. It's a good old fashioned steak shop feel. Service was acceptable but a little slow. The charcuterie was great, but the meatloaf and chopped salad we're lack luster. The salad was tons of ice Berg and minimal everything else .. Seriously it was maybe 2 ounces total of everything else , but the dressing was good. Meatloaf was 4 stars and it came with mashed potatoes that we're descent. Sorry no pix, but they weren't worth showing."
565,The Grill On The Alley,"Bland chicken picatta. Couldn't taste anything in the sauce. Be aware, Bread was salted and butter was salted.  French onion soup also barely had any flavor."
566,The Grill On The Alley,"Great wine menu, cocktails and some nice dishes. Prices are high but you get quality in return. Beautifully decorated. Seats are booths so you have some privacy. Depending on the staff assigned to your seat you can expect excellent service or above average service."
567,The Grill On The Alley,"I am a huge fan of steaks, so i love coming here for my month protein. Usually never have a problem, however this encounter, our waiter was very slow. He took the longest time to bring out our food and messed up on our drinks."
568,The Grill On The Alley,"I went here with colleges and had the scallops, they were amazing. Best if all was my server, I wish I knew he's name, he had a short beard and is someone I would want working for me. I cannot speak enough about his service it was beyond amazing!"
569,The Grill On The Alley,Great service... we really enjoyed ourselves. Located in the Fairmont in downtown San Jose. Walking distance from many attractions. We went to Christmas in the Park after. From the soup to the steak we shared we enjoyed it all. We were going to go the McCormicks and Smith‚Äôs but ended up here which was a delight. So glad this happened by mistake. We will be back.
570,The Grill On The Alley,"Awesome traditional steak restaurant in a beautiful setting.  We always visit before Christmas in the Park or other downtown SJ events.  Impeccable service,  great wine list, and the menu is packed with great dishes.   My favorites are the Filet Medallions in Roquefort Sauce and the beef short ribs which are so tender they fall apart with a poke of the fork.   My wife loves the John Dory fish dish.   Also the key lime pie for dessert is totally on point."
571,The Grill On The Alley,"The Grill on the Alley was recommend by a wonderful friend. I took my mom to this restaurant for her birthday, and she said that I couldn't have thought of anything else more special than The Alley! I ordered the salmon which was fabulous with melted butter on top, and my mom ordered The Cowboy cut... She said that it was the best steak ever! She literally cut it with her butter knife! My mom also ordered the lobster bisque which she said was the absolute best! Oh and the garlic bread was so delicious I was full by the time my salmon entree came to the table! We both give this restaurant 5 stars for the food, 5 stars for the ambience, and 5 stars for the service! Four thumbs up!"
572,The Grill On The Alley,"Main bar is closed due to water damage, so we ate at the back bar. Not as good as the regular bar. Bartender was really good and fast, however food was not up to usual standards."
573,The Grill On The Alley,"I liked my red velvet martini, and the calamari. My broccoli was cool in temp, medallions great cook and flavor, but only warm in temp, salad had too much dressing. I'd go  back for cocktails and appetizers but not dinner."
574,The Grill On The Alley,"Went for our anniversary. many seats overlook a creek that is lit at night. Menu is simple but well done, they welcome substitutions and portion size changes. Parking is good. reservations suggested as they do get busy. the staff is quite knowledgeable. The house wine is good."
575,The Grill On The Alley,"My wife and I took our son to The Grill to celebrate his 21st.  They both enjoy steak.  I'm vegan for health reasons.  I found our waiter to be extremely rude.  When my wife asked about vegan options.  The waiter replied in a snooty, condescending manner:  ""Well, this is a steak house.""  I selected the pasta option minus the seafood.  The pasta was disgusting.  Clearly, if you have a vegetarian or vegan in your group ""STAY AWAY FROM THE GRILL.""  As an aside, the waiter looked as though he had slept in his white uniform for at least the last couple of nights.  Maybe The Grill should have their uniforms laundered at least weekly."
576,The Grill On The Alley,"I ate at The Grill while traveling on business. I was staying at the Fairmont (this is basically the hotel restaurant). While the atmosphere is typical ‚Äústeakhouse,‚Äù I was impressed by the food. The filet was enormous and incredibly flavorful. My drink was made incorrectly but when pointed out to the server, was immediately remedied and the end result was delicious. Good service, good food, right by a bunch of San Jose hotels. Perfect for a business trip."
577,The Grill On The Alley,"The food was absolutely fantastic! Our bartender ROB was the best!! We will definitely return, very impressed with all of the food!! This place is a must stop if you're in the area!"
578,The Grill On The Alley,"As expected from a restaurant attached to a luxury hotel this steakhouse is very good.  The staff is attentive without being intrusive and were quick to respond to any requests.  I had the 20oz cowboy rib eye steak which had an excellent char to it while still maintaining a mouthwatering juicy center.  The butternut squash soup was excellent, very smooth, however there was a small chunk of onion that the immersion blender missed.  I also had a wedge salad which also met expectations.  The creamed spinach with the steak was delightful.  I look forward to coming back here."
579,The Grill On The Alley,Fantastic steaks and wine. Clearly pricey but you get what you pay for here. I recommend sitting by the bar as the menu is a tad cheaper
580,The Grill On The Alley,Always a pleasure to go to the Grill. Love the appetizers and a glass of wine to start. Chicken moist and tender. Love the vegetables are cooked perfectly to keep flavor and not soggy. Atmosphere is wonderful and the bar is always attentive to keep your not waiting around if you want another glass. Mr. J. Gibson came around to the tables and was friendly and intent on the customer service satisfaction. A very good people person. Wish we lived closer and we would partake more often.
581,The Grill On The Alley,"Consistently great meats, excellent service and good value on wines and drinks."
582,The Grill On The Alley,"Great steak and salmon. Outstanding with good service. Got our dessert order wrong, but corrected it with class"
583,The Grill On The Alley,"Nice place! Although We have waited quite long for the order, I still rated it 5 stars, cause the staff was pretty easy-going and polite. The food was Terrific."
584,The Grill On The Alley,"GREAT hotel restaurant!!! From the creative foods, outstanding service to the spectacular views, this place is FABULOUS! No service beats Angela, Karla, Cecilia and Bernardo! This team has it all worked out!!! Can't wait to go back!"
585,The Grill On The Alley,"Good soup, great steak, nice atmosphere."
586,The Grill On The Alley,Perfectly cooked steak
587,The Grill On The Alley,"Amazing food, loved the foie gras and lobster mashed potatoes. Great cocktail lounge as well."
588,The Grill On The Alley,"Very nice steaks and wine. Quite surprised at the quality inn meat, so it was a good find!"
589,The Grill On The Alley,Quality food n service. Special occasion place. Get the tomahawk!
590,The Grill On The Alley,The Grill has solid food. I have been living in SJ since I can remember and each one of my visits to the Alley has been superb.
591,The Grill On The Alley,"This highly rated restaurant deserves all its accolades, for outstanding food, superb service (even to the valet parking available), and beautiful atmosphere. We sat in the main courtyard, near the pool, with the sky overhead. The fountain and lighting, as well as small pool, added to the atmosphere. The caesar salad was as good as reviewers had noted. The tortilla‚Ä¶"
592,The Grill On The Alley,Absolutely wonderful service! The chicken piccata was tender and full of flavor.  Would definately recommend and return for another meal.
593,The Grill On The Alley,"Wow one of the best meals I think I have ever eaten, went during lunch, not many people inside. very clean (I have seen the inside kitchen also) my meal was just as I requested, seasoned perfectly, steak cooked exactly right. Servers most friendly I have ever experienced, will return many times again! Very Highly recommended!"
594,The Grill On The Alley,"Steaks and service are hit and miss. When it's good, it's real good.   Tastefully crafted steaks and sides"
595,The Grill On The Alley,Nice low key restaurant with steaks and desert. It‚Äôs a great alternative to more expensive steak houses.
596,The Grill On The Alley,"Very good steakhouse in San Jose! All four of our steaks were cooked to perfection, and the service was very good! If you are looking to pay for a good quality steak, this is your spot!"
597,The Grill On The Alley,Had fun at a party there
598,The Grill On The Alley,"Lamb chops that slice like velvet butter, sides like sauted brussel sprouts, pan seared lobster and mashed potatoes,  crispy and satisfying popcorn shrimp and a massive dessert to finish it all off.  The only bit that could be improved was the waiter was eager to interrupt us to serve but the food and ambiance was deserving of 5 star laudations."
599,The Grill On The Alley,I let the leftovers sit in my fridge for a week and it was still the best meat I've had in my life
600,The Grill On The Alley,"Happy hour is amazing here. Whenever I stop by, which is often, I order my main meal-a side car-then I finish off with some food. Excellent service, knowledgeable staff, and strong libations."
601,The Grill On The Alley,"Pricey but awesome filet mignon.   Exceptional service, unbelievable food. I comes with a particular price tag ... but it is fine dining"
602,The Grill On The Alley,"Very good restaurants for meat lovers, you can choose from all kinds of steaks. Staff service went great, affordable prices."
603,The Grill On The Alley,"Amazing martinis, great happy hour, wonderful staff!"
604,The Grill On The Alley,"Fantastic ambience, food and service. Worth the time and $..Had a New York steak and souffl√©..Awesome seating with 3 screen in front of where I sit..üëç"
605,The Grill On The Alley,Don't miss this place. We are breakfast snobs and this is a place we would go out of our way to go back to. Huge portions. Our fav is the hash brown skillet with chorizo added. Yummy! Their salsa is great so ask for extra.
606,The Grill On The Alley,"The menu, food preparation and service has never disappointed. Consistently good and if you want to treat some employees to a truly special evening for the holidays, this is a great place to make a good impression."
607,The Grill On The Alley,Steak is like butter! I am in heaven! Amazing waiter as well!
608,The Grill On The Alley,The Food is delicious I've been here with my girlfriend Kimberley Alvarez love the grill selection.
609,The Grill On The Alley,"An excellent place to grab a cocktail or an after dinner desert and people watch! Tucked to the side of the Fairmont Hotel you can dress casually (it is San Jose after all), but you'll probably feel a bit under dressed."
610,The Grill On The Alley,"Filet, calamari, Mac and cheese, wine selection. ALL AWESOME. Highly recommended."
611,The Grill On The Alley,"Delicious filet mignon and friendly service, great for date night. It's located at the Fairmont hotel and convenient to downtown San Jose near lots of other attractions."
612,The Grill On The Alley,Excellent service ambience & cuisine!!!
613,The Grill On The Alley,Delicious food. I had a ribeye that was amazing. Nothing the cheapest place in town but I can't wait to go back.
614,The Grill On The Alley,"I had a very productive business dinner here. The food was delicious, the wine was good, and the service was friendly."
615,The Grill On The Alley,Had crab cake as a starter and New York strip as main. Great food!!! Good service.
616,The Grill On The Alley,Great lunch and service. Try the calamari and NY steak.
617,The Grill On The Alley,"Great Happy Hour drinks and apps!  One of those rare finds, an upscale place with good deals.  Martinis are delish, especially the Ruby Red Lemon Drop Martini!  The one thing I found less that good was an Ahi Tuna and Avocado Stack that we ordered.  The tuna was extremely bland and the wontons served with it were as well."
618,The Grill On The Alley,Loved the lobster bisque
619,The Grill On The Alley,"We really enjoyed their Thanksgiving specials: Prime Rib, Filet Mignon, and Salmon. All were excellent, but the salmon was really something special: perfectly cooked so that it was still tender and moist, topped with crab and bernaise, on a bed of mashed celeriac. It all went together so well! The only food complaints were that the Prime Ribs were lukewarm and drinks were on the sweet side. The service was excellent, with a couple of minor issues: they didn't warn us that the Prime Ribs were TWO POUNDS each, and they forgot to bring the accompanying au jus."
620,The Grill On The Alley,The service was very nice and pleasant.
621,The Grill On The Alley,"Fresh salad, I love bread and delicious pot pie. Nice atmosphere."
622,The Grill On The Alley,The food was absolutely wonderful and the service was superb.
623,The Grill On The Alley,"got there near five, it wasn't very busy. bring your appetite because portions are large."
624,Taurinus Brazilian Steakhouse,"This is a 4 star, casual, kid-friendly place for Brazilian food and steaks with good parking options which also serves alcohol."
625,Taurinus Brazilian Steakhouse,"Love this place. One it's close to my house. But the food is always good. Remember it's always medium rare. You have to ask for well done. Staff is super friendly. My wife and I come here at least once a month. Usually twice. Come hungry!!  And get everything. Wine, caipirinha, and a desert. Make sure you book a reservation if you don‚Äôt want to wait. Val Eu."
626,Taurinus Brazilian Steakhouse,"Finest food, super nice staff members, consistently good mood. They charge affordable rates and the food quality is very good. Great work."
627,Taurinus Brazilian Steakhouse,"Outstanding is the best description. Not one dish that was awesome- from start to finish. Delicious, inventive, yet light and not overpowering. Complete perfection!"
628,Taurinus Brazilian Steakhouse,This spot is worth a try. They have large portions for affordable prices. Regularly neat and with excellent ambience. Would recommend to others.
629,Taurinus Brazilian Steakhouse,"Saturday morning placed online reservations for two @5:30pm
Arrived at 5pm. There was plenty of parking spaces on all of the side streets at this time.
The restaurant had a line out the door but were seating people quickly.
We were seated at 5:15.
First time here we were not sure what to do. They will assume you know and will let you sit there until you ask.
Basically, you go get a plate and wander around the island bar picking up items buffet style.
When you are back at your table there is a rotating wheel that is green and red. If you have it on green the waiters will bring skewers of meat for you. If red, they will pass you by.
The place filled up very fast.
Pros:
1. Everything is very good.
2. Fast and friendly.
3. Price was comparable to other restaurants of this type in the area (FogoDC), but better in my opinion.

Cons:
1. They don‚Äôt explain the process to you.
2. Single men‚Äôs and a single woman‚Äôs restroom. You‚Äôd be better off pissing out back.
3. The tables and chairs are so packed in that you are constantly banging into the chair behind you. It‚Äôs impossible to walk straight to where you want to go. So hard to navigate around tables and people you don‚Äôt even want to get up. I don‚Äôt know the occupant fire code but it has to be at the limit or above.

Overall opinion:

I would go again.
5 stars for food quality.

Poor restroom accommodations and
lack of explaining the process is a big part of the experience.
That is why I rate it 3 stars."
630,Taurinus Brazilian Steakhouse,"Heard great things about Taurinus Brazilian Steakhouse and the idea of the Brazilian style Steakhouse.  There was the best Brazilian BBQ which I‚Äôve ever had. The meat was excellent quality. And then, there are desserts. This was the first time when I ordered Pudim. So many options for everyone. A great experience in general."
631,Taurinus Brazilian Steakhouse,I was at the place on Sunday around 2am the place was super full a nice blonde girl took us to the table. soon the waitress came to us. Amanda was her name explained to us how everything worked she treated us kindly. even with the place full of customers it did not fail. with great attention to everyone I will always come back it is a nice place with good employees
632,Taurinus Brazilian Steakhouse,"Everything was perfectly cooked, paired, and beyond satisfying for the price. The food was excellent and the waiter we had was very knowledgeable about the dishes and various wine and beers."
633,Taurinus Brazilian Steakhouse,"Finest food, super nice staff members, consistently good mood. They charge affordable rates and the food quality is very good. Great work."
634,Taurinus Brazilian Steakhouse,"Taurinus Brazilian Steakhouse was quite a mouthful. Lets be upfront and say it is expensive but as long as you're prepared for that in advance and you're up for it you're going to have an excellent experience. Its all you can eat meat and salad. You self serve the salad and some sides whenever you feel like it and the waiters bring you meat on the skewer as they make their rounds. You can have as much meat as you want but you take a portion at a time. They cut it on the skewer and you hold it with tongs (see my video). The meat is absolutely delicious, awesomely seasoned and beautifully cooked. The staff are all friendly and accommodating of special needs and earned a significant tip from us."
635,Taurinus Brazilian Steakhouse,"Outstanding is the best description. Not one dish that was awesome- from start to finish. Delicious, inventive, yet light and not overpowering. Complete perfection!"
636,Taurinus Brazilian Steakhouse,This spot is worth a try. They have large portions for affordable prices. Regularly neat and with excellent ambience. Would recommend to others.
637,Taurinus Brazilian Steakhouse,Our kids had their dads Retirement dinner here. Food was superb! Service was fantastic. It was a perfect evening. My mouth is watering just thinking about the flavors of all the different meats offered. Our guests said the appetizers were delicious. We got nothing but compliments on the choice of having his special day there. I Highly recommend Taurinus Brazilian Steak House for a special event or even a dinner date. I can‚Äôt wait to go back.
638,Taurinus Brazilian Steakhouse,Had a awesome experience in this place with my wife. The food arrives quickly and the service is just great. Prices are reasonable.
639,Taurinus Brazilian Steakhouse,"Definitely a place worth stopping by, the food is awesome and fresh, the cost is reasonable and it is consistently clean there. Keep up the good work."
640,Taurinus Brazilian Steakhouse,"Saturday morning placed online reservations for two @5:30pm Arrived at 5pm. There was plenty of parking spaces on all of the side streets at this time. The restaurant had a line out the door but were seating people quickly. We were seated at 5:15. First time here we were not sure what to do. They will assume you know and will let you sit there until you ask. Basically, you go get a plate and wander around the island bar picking up items buffet style. When you are back at your table there is a rotating wheel that is green and red. If you have it on green the waiters will bring skewers of meat for you. If red, they will pass you by. The place filled up very fast. Pros: 1. Everything is very good. 2. Fast and friendly. 3. Price was comparable to other restaurants of this type in the area (FogoDC), but better in my opinion.

Overall opinion: I would go again. 5 stars for food quality. Poor restroom accommodations and lack of explaining the process is a big part of the experience. That is why I rate it 3 stars."
641,Taurinus Brazilian Steakhouse,This place always surpasses my expectations everytime. Always friendly and filling. Best meats around and vanilla/peanut butter ice cream pie slice that is out of this world.
642,Taurinus Brazilian Steakhouse,"I'll keep this short n sweet..AMAZING place if you want to grub on all kinds of meat.. Nice salad bar & wine list. Can be a little loud , but not to bad. Go there hungry. One set price and all the steak..pork..chicken..sausage and more you can handle."
643,Taurinus Brazilian Steakhouse,The food is always great. A good selection of specials for appetizers or entrees always keeps it interesting. Will be back soon.
644,Taurinus Brazilian Steakhouse,"Friendly staff and a bunch of tasty meat.  I enjoyed every thing I tried.  The standout for me was the sausage and the flank steak.  The rest of my table also enjoyed their meals.  The salad/appetizer bar was well appointed as well.  For drinks, I only had Ice Tea (which if you've seen my reviews is probably shocking lol), but the glass was basically always full, and I can't ask for more than that."
645,Taurinus Brazilian Steakhouse,So much meat. I was impressed. For three of us it was enough. Our waiter was awesome. We made a quick order based on his recommendations. And you know what .... he didn‚Äôt disappoint us. High quality customer service. Thanks a lot. They made our day.
646,Taurinus Brazilian Steakhouse,Went there with some colleagues. It is what you expect from pretty much any Brazilian steakhouse. Loads of meat and a very nice buffet. But what really makes the difference is the staff working there. They were all very nice and friendly which makes the experience all the more enjoyable.
647,Taurinus Brazilian Steakhouse,So amazing. Amazing food. Great experience. Very attentive staff.
648,Taurinus Brazilian Steakhouse,"I celebrated my graduation today in this fine place. happy to tell that it was a pleasant evening and the restaurant was indeed one of the reasons for this strong event. The stuff  participated in a very nice style, the food was great and my guests were so  pleased. We shall definitely visit again for more joyful events. Thank you very much."
649,Taurinus Brazilian Steakhouse,Home away from home. Loved this place. Being a Brazilian I can say that this place it's really authentic and follows the tradition perfectly. The food was amazing and the service so friendly. All you can eat meet for just 29.95 is totally worth it. Plus some cheese bread and polenta sent right to your table is just amazing.
650,Taurinus Brazilian Steakhouse,"If you have eaten at a Brazilian place before you know what to expect. You sit down and get served some cheese bread, plantains and polenta sticks. There is a self serve salad bar which has a great section and then you sit down and turn your dial to green.  The wait staff then come around and offer you meat cooked on long metal skewers.  Note, you can ask for a rarer cut if that's your preferred choice or the outside cut off you want it more Cooked. There is a huge offering of meats.  Chicken, lamb, pork and so many cuts of beef that you will easily find the one you love. If you want more of a type of cut the staff will happily bring it to you. It should be noted that it's not cheap and nowhere does it tell you the cost which is kind of frustrating.  3 adults 1 child and some ice tea/soft drinks cost $250."
651,Taurinus Brazilian Steakhouse,"Always love coming to Taurinus! My most recent visit was for my mom's birthday. The cuts of meat are delicious and the buffet and salad bar has great options and even get to try some dishes I've never had before. Great for special occasions, wonderful service."
652,Taurinus Brazilian Steakhouse,I had a fantastic time in this restaurant. We loved the wonderful ambience and the menu. The staff members are very affable. I‚Äôm happy we ultimately managed to visit this restaurant.
653,Taurinus Brazilian Steakhouse,"The customer service is always swift, good character, super friendly staff members. I will visit here again when I get in the area."
654,Taurinus Brazilian Steakhouse,A neat buffet on wheels. Actually barbaric in it's presentation. Five minutes into the dinner I wondered what the hell I was doing here in the cafeteria setting. Plus getting the bill for high hundreds for two people was a shock and made me wish that someone would actually help the San Jose cuisine market with good food and ambiance. Not sure why the area is void of good restaurants? Plenty of money to go around. Mr. Beard please send some friends to the Silicon Valley.
655,Taurinus Brazilian Steakhouse,"Last week was the first time we visited this place. But It is no doubt not the last time. We had a good time with the excellent service, with the fine  meal and fine drinks and with the decent payment. We will no doubt visit there soon."
656,Taurinus Brazilian Steakhouse,"Went here for a company lunch and I cant say I was impressed. First off the tables are so close together that you have no room to move without bumping into the table(s) near you. I felt like a sardine in a can. Because they packed so many people into a smaller space it was to loud and I couldn't even here the person 2-3 seats away. As for the food, well that left something to be desired as well. Everything I tried an the buffet bar was cold an unappetizing  and in regards to the all you can eat meat, on this particular day at least all the Sirloin was served rare to just barely med rare, which is way too bloody for my taste. Chicken was served on the bone and if you like dark meat was probably suitable. Pork ribs didn't have much meat. The parmesan pork cubes and the red wine sirloin cubes were cooked well and had good taste. Servers didn't come around as much as I thought that they would so unfortunately for me only having two meats to eat and the few times servers came around left me leaving hungry and unsatisfied. I am just thankful that I didn't have to pay for this meal."
657,Taurinus Brazilian Steakhouse,Had a excellent experience in here with my kids. The food was served quickly and the service is just awesome. Prices are affordable.
658,Taurinus Brazilian Steakhouse,"It is very expensive but delicious. Skip the rice, the vegetables and anything in ""buffet area"" and turn the sign green. They will be bringing out a variety of meats ranging from beef, pork, chicken, and goat on rotation. If you keep the sign green, you will be overwhelmed and run out of plate space."
659,Taurinus Brazilian Steakhouse,"Service was great and the meat was tasty. Their salads were delish and I'm only sorry they don't offer a fruit salad. I guess they want to sell desserts. The lava cake was not terrific. I wouldn't have it again. Be prepared to spend a pretty penny. A nice place to splurge on. Great atmosphere and service. What sets this place apart from similar Brazilian steakhouses is the salad/hot bar and explanation/willing of services. Upfront the server tells you if the meat is not cooked to your liking, they can roast it up more and serve it to you (didn't have any problem) and they encourage you to order what you want. Downside is if you come at dinner time, you don't see all the meats available when you're seated at the corner. We only found out there was different types of meat available when I stopped chomping on what was on my plate and looked around. I asked our server if she could send the guys over."
660,Taurinus Brazilian Steakhouse,"Great customer service, amazing food, and a wonderful unique experience! I highly recommend you check this place out!"
661,Taurinus Brazilian Steakhouse,Had a fantastic experience in here with my girlfriend. The food arrives quick and the service is just awesome. Prices are reasonable.
662,Taurinus Brazilian Steakhouse,"The food is regularly well prepared and yummy, cashiers provides awesome customer service. I really like how clean it is and vibes. Would recommend to others."
663,Taurinus Brazilian Steakhouse,"My husband and I hit this place up when we are in San Jose. Great service, usually easy parking...don't run in and forget to put coins in your meter. The food is beyond perfect. Your happy and full every visit. Thanks Taurnis, keep doing what your doing!"
664,Taurinus Brazilian Steakhouse,"The place offers a fantastic variety of delicious food. I enjoyed eating here. Staff members are always nice, rates are convenient and the spot is always kept clean."
665,Taurinus Brazilian Steakhouse,"two days ago was the first time we visited this magnificent restaurant. But It is obviously not the last time. We had a good time with the attentive service, with the great  cuisine and wine and with the decent pay. We will definitely come back in a short time."
666,Taurinus Brazilian Steakhouse,I just love their food. I always get awesome service here. The place is well kept and the staff members are always very friendly. Highly recommended.
667,Taurinus Brazilian Steakhouse,We travel up this way every once in a while. Great and tasty food! Can be a bit pricey though! Customer was excellent as well.
668,Taurinus Brazilian Steakhouse,"In recent memory, I can truly say I have not had a better dining experience. From 'hello' to 'good-bye', this place was inviting, warm and overall an amazing experience. The food was incredible (their sirloin and roasted pineapple was particularly awesome), and everyone we met was accommodating and friendly. I won't go too in-depth into how the servings are set up, but rest assured there are PLENTY of delicious options  We're not from the area, but this place gets the highest of marks from my girlfriend and I, and you can guarantee we're recommending this place to everyone that comes through the area."
669,Taurinus Brazilian Steakhouse,"Around the corner from the main drag, easy to miss if you're craning your neck looking for parking. Amazing food, beautiful self serve entree and salad bars. The ten or fifteen different kinds of meats are brought around to your table and sliced right off the skewer it was just roasted on. Cheerful, attentive staff, and you'll meet most of them, because they come to you. One price for dinner,  all you can eat. Great place for a special dinner, room for a medium size crowd. Fantastic experience. Plan to walk around downtown for a while afterward."
670,Taurinus Brazilian Steakhouse,"It was a nice experience - the last time I had been to a churrascaria was a few years ago in Austin, and it had left such a lasting impression on me that I was excited to relive it in San Jose. However nothing out here compares to the meats you get in Texas - some of the meats served were too salty and dry. The chicken, on the other hand was delicious and juicy - the sirloin was great too! The lamb was cooked the same way as the beef so it lacked the distinguishing taste and felt a bit chewy. The service was great! Not sure if I would come back here in a hurry - we spent nearly 250 for a party of 3 - the quantity was worth it, but not the quality."
671,Taurinus Brazilian Steakhouse,"Food is good, lots of choices at the salad bar. The service is kind of hit or miss depending on who you wave down. Pretty pricey, honestly in my opinion you're paying for the experience."
672,Taurinus Brazilian Steakhouse,"Had a great time with my gf enjoying everything on the menu . Great service ,great food definitely would recommend"
673,Taurinus Brazilian Steakhouse,"Enjoyed a nice lunch here today complimentary of the company that my boyfriend works for. The place itself is small, but nice. I would definitely recommend making reservations as I am not sure how busy this place gets. There was a salad bar/buffet with a variety of salads, meats, cheeses, olives, etc. & the buffet offered mashed potatoes, rice, beef some sort of sauce, and a ravioli. Not sure if these items are always out and part of the meal, but it was nice to have the variety with all the meats that were passed around. Servers came around with a variety of sausages, pork, chicken and steak. Tried all of the options of meat brought out. My favorite was the tri-tip with provolone cheese. There were some I could do without, but that's the nice thing about sampling everything so that you know what you like and aren't committed to one thing. They come around with grilled pineapple at the end to help with digestion. Grilled pineapple is quite yummy. The staff was nice and attentive. Overall, had a nice experience here today."
674,Taurinus Brazilian Steakhouse,"One of my main spots to grab some food. convenient location, clean, and fantastic customer service. Keep it up!"
675,Taurinus Brazilian Steakhouse,"One of the best steakhouses I have been to! Excellent service, such a variety of different meats and they come out so quickly, you aren't spending time just waiting for food to come out. You definitely get your money's worth of options and food quantity! The food was excellent, I like my steak well done, they quickly came out with well done meat for me. I came with a baby (10mo) and they were so helpful and kind, overall my family and I had an excellent experience and I highly recommend it to all my friends."
676,Taurinus Brazilian Steakhouse,Such a great experience. The staff is very polite and the meat choice is to die for! I will definitely give another try once I am town!
677,Taurinus Brazilian Steakhouse,"My fav place for Brazilian food. Visited near twelve, it was not full. Quick, helpful, and friendly service. The bill was average for the menu. I see why this place has so many good reviews."
678,Taurinus Brazilian Steakhouse,"My wife and I came in 15 minutes before closing and we were treated like family. The food and service was excellent. Compliments to the chef, staff and managment for an overall exceptional dinner."
679,Taurinus Brazilian Steakhouse,I get to eat here a lot since I work right next to it. I love how the customer service is always excellent and they keep the spot clean regularly. Rates are reasonable and they serve generous portions.
680,Taurinus Brazilian Steakhouse,"This place is awesome! Reasonable rates, considerable dishes and the staff members are consistently super friendly."
681,Taurinus Brazilian Steakhouse,"Definitely a most go if you are starving because they serve a lot of food. The waiters were all friendly and efficient at their jobs. The salad bar is full of options, they bring in quite a selection of meats to choose from chicken/pork/beef and even fruit. The staff did an amazing job serving my 10+ party last time we went and I will bring my family in soon."
682,Taurinus Brazilian Steakhouse,"Amazing place, go for lunch for the best deal. Be careful if your set to green, they will give you no room to breath. Gotta set that thing to red quite a bit."
683,Taurinus Brazilian Steakhouse,"Around the corner from the main drag, easy to miss if you're craning your neck looking for parking. Amazing food, beautiful self serve entree and salad bars.

684,Taurinus Brazilian Steakhouse,I really loved their dishes. I always get fantastic customer service there. The place is always clean and the staff members are always friendly. I highly recommend this place.
685,Taurinus Brazilian Steakhouse,"Surely a place worth stopping over, the food is fantastic and well prepared, the cost is affordable and it is always neat in here. 5 stars."
686,Taurinus Brazilian Steakhouse,Awesome service. They explain the food in detail if asked. Great choices for sides.
687,Taurinus Brazilian Steakhouse,I admire this venue a lot. theres a happy ambiance. The food is very tasty. the service is powerful and the personel is very professional. The cost is decent. greatly recommend.
688,Taurinus Brazilian Steakhouse,"I liked the food. Best thing was actually the salmon with capers. Next best thing we're the bananas. I think I sampled all the meats that they brought to the table. Good, but not great, so 4 stars instead of 5. I also got the creme brulee, which was good, but again, not 5 stars. The manager came to our table to chat and was friendly."
689,Taurinus Brazilian Steakhouse,Was good meat collection. Nice salad bar. Meat was well seasoned and well cooked. I was invited so I really don't have any idea about how much was it. Parking structure was across the street. Seating was ok. Room for improvement. Certainly will try it again.
690,Taurinus Brazilian Steakhouse,Amazing food and service. Delicious sirloin and great selection of sides.
691,Taurinus Brazilian Steakhouse,Brazilian food and the atmosphere at this place is excellent. Loved this place from the first taste. Really nothing but good experiences here.
692,Taurinus Brazilian Steakhouse,I always come by getting some food in this place. I like the swift customer service and well cooked food. I recommend this place.
693,Taurinus Brazilian Steakhouse,Amazing steak and service! Everything was absolutely delicious. I highly recommend this place!
694,Taurinus Brazilian Steakhouse,A Variety of quality meats and a salad bar that is beyond other salad bars and excellent service
695,Taurinus Brazilian Steakhouse,"Meats and service were phenomenal. Spendy and could be a more relaxed atmosphere. Was a lot of fun for our company team outing. Personal highlights were the lamb leg, filet mignon, and picanha. Solid wines and can't go wrong with their desserts. We particularly likedbthe peanut butter thing and Petit gateau."
696,Taurinus Brazilian Steakhouse,"Nice restaurant for a family meal!!! excellent service, delicious food at reasonable prices!"
697,Taurinus Brazilian Steakhouse,"Certainly a place worth stopping over, the food is awesome and fresh, the costs are reasonable and it is constantly neat here. Fantastic work."
698,Taurinus Brazilian Steakhouse,"We come to this place whenever we are celebrating a life event. Unlike any other Brazilian Steakhouse, this is a small family business, and they really bring out the authentic Brazilian flavors and cultural feel. The staff is not just friendly, but extra accommodating and hospitable."
699,Taurinus Brazilian Steakhouse,"Don't miss out! I believe it's around $50-60/person, but there's enough food to fill you up. Make sure to have a very light lunch, to really enjoy their dinner."
700,Taurinus Brazilian Steakhouse,"The service people are nice and all the food is good. The price is reasonable for the amount and quality of food that you get. In addition to the meat skewers that they carry around, they have grilled pineapple skewers which are sweet and a nice break between the meats."
701,Taurinus Brazilian Steakhouse,Service was so good. Will enjoy going back. Even the salad bar was yummy!  Some meats better than others.. garlic steak was the fave!
702,Taurinus Brazilian Steakhouse,This is a great place with great food. The flavors are wonderful and I enjoy the friendliness and camaraderie of the restaurant. Perfect place to go just with friends or that first date you have to try the barbecue pineapple. Amazing
703,Taurinus Brazilian Steakhouse,Omg.!!!!!! Great food. The meats were off the hook and the side dish were amazing and tasted. I will definitely be back to try others dishes  there and my mom was very impressed on how good everything was Thank You again for the grrreat hospitality and service there see you soon...ü§óü§óü§ó
704,Taurinus Brazilian Steakhouse,Fantastic meal. Excellent service. Arrive hungry; leave full. The Peanut Butter Thing dessert is delicious.
705,Taurinus Brazilian Steakhouse,Servers are very attentive they will make sure to ask what person if they wanted to have some meat. Other Brazilian Steakhouses don't bother to come back if they run out of meat for the while party. We got to try all the meat they had available and everything was delicious. Drinks were filled constantly and I love the way they treat their patrons. Best choice for Brazilian steakhouse in San Jose.
706,Taurinus Brazilian Steakhouse,"Having lived in Brazil and having been to many churrascarias in the U.S., I can say that Taurinus is pretty average, middle of the pack. Espetus is probably the best you can get in the Bay Area and Taurinus was a couple of steps below in terms of grilling preparation, service, and quality of the salad bar. But it was plenty to satisfy a craving for grilled meats, and I would come back if the dinner prices were a little cheaper."
707,Taurinus Brazilian Steakhouse,Once again a perfect meal. Asked to change my reservation at the last minute and they were able to accommodate us. The food was outstanding (and they've added items since the last time we've been there).
708,Taurinus Brazilian Steakhouse,Smaller than other Brazilian steakhouses but easier to get the cuts you want (because its smaller). Parking is bothersome because there is no validation but I try to go as often as I can. Worth a visit if you love meat!
709,Taurinus Brazilian Steakhouse,"Fun! Good experience went for lunch which is less expensive. Think we finally tasted all 8 meats. Go light on the very nice Salad Bar, save room for a sample of all 8. We split a sausage and each ate half of that nothing special for us. The 2 pork choices were a south tip and an amazing pork loin encrusted in Parmesan!! I also liked the beer battered wings. I have no ideas if the lunch menu is different daily or not. Nice atmosphere. Nice bar menu."
710,Taurinus Brazilian Steakhouse,My top spot for Brazilian food. One of the best spots of its kind in the area. The bill was appropriate for the quality.
711,Taurinus Brazilian Steakhouse,Brazilian food at this spot - very tasty. staff is always super even when they have a full house. the staff was friendly and observant. this place has a cool design.
712,Taurinus Brazilian Steakhouse,The drink options were amazing and all of the food was excellent. Keep it up guys!
713,Taurinus Brazilian Steakhouse,"Best service of all the Bay Area Brazilian steakhouses. Their salad bar items are seasoned really well, and of course the cheesy bread is delicious. It's pricey, but a great occasional treat or celebratory meal. Come hungry!"
714,Taurinus Brazilian Steakhouse,"brazilian food, so fresh. great ambiance & decor. the service was very helpful and welcoming."
715,Taurinus Brazilian Steakhouse,This place is great!  The 5 stars go just on the fact that they were able to accommodate a large group of friends no problem.  I can see how this is probably not for large grpups but if need to they are willing to accommodate.
716,Taurinus Brazilian Steakhouse,A fav place for tasty brazilian food. Cool place to meet and catch up with coworkers. It has a good interior. Food is like a restaurant in Louisville I loved.
717,Taurinus Brazilian Steakhouse,Absolutely delicious food and fabulous service!!
718,Taurinus Brazilian Steakhouse,We celebrated our 22nd anniversary. Nice place to have a romantic dinner with the wife or girlfriend.
719,Taurinus Brazilian Steakhouse,"First time at a Brazilian Steak House and it was awesome. The staff was very attentive and told us how it all worked.  The meats were amazingly prepared at the right temperature and kept coming until we were done. We were there for 2 hours and never felt rushed. Salad bar is very good with lots of options, but don't over eat from here the entrees just keep coming!"
720,Taurinus Brazilian Steakhouse,"We love this place! I'd say best Brazilian steakhouse house in the bay area! It doesn't try too hard to be fancy like some other restaurants. Prices are reasonable. Family oriented. They don't charge for toddlers like in some other fancy-wanna-be Brazilian steakhouses. Very friendly staff. Great meat and salad options! If you love steak and live in the SF bay area, this place has your name written all over it! Don't think twice.   The beef ribs melt in your mouth"
721,Taurinus Brazilian Steakhouse,"The salad bar is, in fact, exquisite. What they do really well here is roast meat.  Lots of meat. More than 20 different kinds and cuts. Yum. Sizzling delicious meat..."
722,Taurinus Brazilian Steakhouse,"Meat  is roasted on metal spits next to fire until perfect. Then brought out to the tables by waiters with long knives.  Portions are carved to order, with everyone getting exactly their preference of rare to well done and thickness of cut in one deft stroke.  It is boisterous fun sharing and comparing all the tasty bits flying around the table. All you can eat, all delicious.  Go easy on yourself and plan to spend some time dining there are many things to sample.   Got to give it as many $ as stars, though to be completely forthcoming,  their wine and cocktails were also quite tasty."
723,Taurinus Brazilian Steakhouse,Fine spot for delicious Brazilian food. I was so full. Looking forward to coming back with my friends. If it was closer to my home I would be here often.
724,Taurinus Brazilian Steakhouse,Ok location for Brazilian food. Great place to meet and catch up with friends. I'll return friends next time. The place has a nice atmosphere.
725,Taurinus Brazilian Steakhouse,Tasty meat choices and all one can eat .
726,Taurinus Brazilian Steakhouse,Very delicious. They don't stop bringing different Meats and pineapple until you tell them not to but quite pricey
727,Affinity,This is a 4 star place for American food which also serves alcohol.
728,Affinity,"Food is average, but nice vibe in night"
729,Affinity,"For a hotel restaurant this one os very good.  The service was good food flavorful.  Stopped there during Comic Con.  Only problem was they are a bit lax as a person at the table next to us had his dog in his lap, eating from the table.  Now I understand pets being family and all but at a restaurant?? That is ridiculous.  They should have had a backbone told the person to put the dog back into his carrier."
730,Affinity,Staff is great! Try the jalapeno calamari! It's one of the best around. Nice patio but be forewarned it's directly under the landing flight path to San Jose airport.
731,Affinity,"Good, plentiful,  portions.  Not too expensive for a hotel restaurant.  But, extremely noisy. Couldn't speak to others on our group without shouting."
732,Affinity,"Absolutely horrible service,  the bartender was the only one taking orders while 4 other people where just standing around. I asked if I can please have someone take my order since I have be waiting over 15 mins already. No one could help and didn't handle it in a professional manner. I travel for work and visit many hotels. I never have to actually write down my experience at a hotel because of their service. I have wasted over 40 mins for a take out burger. And most of that time was me waiting for someone to take my order."
733,Affinity,"An omelette is really really expensive. Definitely go for the buffet instead, it is a much better value. The buffet has yogurt, fruits, pancakes, waffles, scrambled eggs, sausages, bacon, cereal, muffins, juices, and much more."
734,Affinity,The chicken alfredo was decent. The drinks were watered down.
735,Affinity,"The staff was nice and friendly, especially Leo."
736,Affinity,"Food is average, but nice vibe in night"

Only problem was they are a bit lax as a person at the table next to us had his dog in his lap, eating from the table.  Now I understand pets being family and all but at a restaurant?? That is ridiculous.  They should have had a backbone told the person to put the dog back into his carrier."
738,Affinity,Staff is great! Try the jalapeno calamari! It's one of the best around. Nice patio but be forewarned it's directly under the landing flight path to San Jose airport.
739,Affinity,"A preferred scene for delicious bar food. Fast, efficient, and courteous service. The place has a great atmosphere. Food is like a restaurant in Louisville I loved."
740,Affinity,"Good, plentiful,  portions.  Not too expensive for a hotel restaurant.  But, extremely noisy. Couldn't speak to others on our group without shouting."
741,Affinity,The food and service was great! And they also validate parking.
742,Affinity,The bar staff is great with a good liquor selection. The beers on tap are all excellent.
743,Affinity,Conveniently located in the Hilton. Friendly staff. Decent pricing
744,Affinity,Food was great! All staff very friendly. Served very quickly. Good value for the money
745,Affinity,"Friendly service, great libations."
746,Affinity,I was surprised by their breakfast buffet as I thought it‚Äôd be very limited in options. The food was great in taste and service was exceptional.
747,Affinity,Totally underrated restaurant! Surprisingly good. Delighted that I discovered it.
748,Affinity,Good food. Expensive. Friendly knowledgeable waiters. Some vegan and gluten free items. Wheelchair accessible. Valet parking available.
749,Affinity,Best hotel restaurant I have seen. The portions were huge and the quality was as good as any stand-alone restaurant.
750,Affinity,"Order Calamari and Sierra Nevada Pale Ale. Well, it is a standard combination. Calamari is just good for liquor snacks, but it's too much to share with the family. I also ordered hamburgers and sandwiches, but they all had a large amount such as french fries and chicken, and eventually I brought them home with doggy bags. Be conservative when ordering!"
751,The Farmers Union,This place has a lovely outdoor seating.
752,The Farmers Union,This is a 4 star Gastropub that serves American food.
753,The Farmers Union,Great experience for my first big dinner party of 8! All guests have temperature checked before seated. We were seated at 2 tables and had Mike as our server. Very attentive and helpful. Everyone enjoyed their meals and a great time was had! Thank you!
754,The Farmers Union,"Went with 3 other friends and were well distanced from any other patrons. Few people had the fried chicken sandwich with spicy slaw and said it was the best chicken sandwich they ever had! Tomato bisque and grilled cheese were excellent too. We had a few local beers while here, but service was a bit on the slow side. Great food and worth the stop"
755,The Farmers Union,"Really awesome place to get some tasty beer, haven't tried the food yet but will be trying next time. Clean and definitely good distance from others. Service was good.
Barrel house big sur double IPA üî•"
756,The Farmers Union,"Our first dinner after moving into town. Nice atmosphere and prices within the typical range of the area. The food was well presented and very flavorful - the meat in the beef tacos was simply stunning.
Our hostess Marina made the experience a five-star one: she was very attentive and respectful of public health guidelines."
757,The Farmers Union,"Fantastic and tasty food, I loved the character this spot has, and the cashiers were welcoming. I will definitely visit here next time."
758,The Farmers Union,"Farmers has always been one of my favorite restaurants in the area! Shout out to Farmers Union for excellent service and incredible food! We ordered two family‚Äôs meals Togo- which were so delicious! This is what we needed for our weekly ‚Äúdine out‚Äù (ok take out) due to this shelter in place. The take out service was great. Arrived just before my request pickup time, and the order was already waiting for me."
759,The Farmers Union,"Really awesome place to get some tasty beer, haven't tried the food yet but will be trying next time. Clean and definitely good distance from others. Service was good. Barrel house big sur double IPA üî•"
760,The Farmers Union,"Absolutely love their new takeout menu. This restaurant has impressively adapted to the new covid restrictions. I regularly order takeout from The Farmers Union & everything I try is fantastic. My boyfriend & I‚Äôs favorites are the Prawn Linguine & their ribs... the chili flavors in the saffron brodo & spice in the bbq sauce is out of this world! We‚Äôve recently tried their cocktails to-go, which are delicious. Also, their pickup window is a cute touch & staff always hands off the bag with a smile. My local favorite American place for sure!"
761,The Farmers Union,"Excellent service, same as the good. Very nice treat!"
762,The Farmers Union,Great experience for my first big dinner party of 8! All guests have temperature checked before seated. We were seated at 2 tables and had Mike as our server. Very attentive and helpful. Everyone enjoyed their meals and a great time was had! Thank you!
763,The Farmers Union,"This place was very busy for dinner before we attended a concert at SAP Center. Luckly, we got there a little early because when we left the line was out the door! There wasn't a table available, so we ate at the bar. Food was pricey, and there weren't any vegetarian options other than a salad. The lamb burger was good, though. Bartender was friendly and efficient. Restaurant was loud."
764,The Farmers Union,"Probably one of my favorite restaurants in San Pedro Square. They have vegan options, fresh produce, an interesting, ever-changing menu selection, and the most fabulous Mac and Cheese. Brunch here also gets rave reviews, but the full menu is not available."
765,The Farmers Union,"Went with 3 other friends and were well distanced from any other patrons. Few people had the fried chicken sandwich with spicy slaw and said it was the best chicken sandwich they ever had! Tomato bisque and grilled cheese were excellent too. We had a few local beers while here, but service was a bit on the slow side. Great food and worth the stop"
766,The Farmers Union,Great experience dining during COVID. Food was excellent and servers were kind and attentive. I will be returning whenever I am in the area.
767,The Farmers Union,Our first dinner after moving into town. Nice atmosphere and prices within the typical range of the area. The food was well presented and very flavorful - the meat in the beef tacos was simply stunning. Our hostess Marina made the experience a five-star one: she was very attentive and respectful of public health guidelines.
768,The Farmers Union,The food here is exquisite. Sometimes the wait is a bit long. Bit they have outdoor seating and its comfortable
769,The Farmers Union,"Great place for dinner. Went there for a birthday. The menu items had a number of creative dishes that were awesome. We had the mushroom cigar which is mushroom wrapped in a spring roll cover and made to look like a cigar. Tasted awesome, the sauce was quite heavy, would have been good with a lighter lemony sauce. But hey you wouldn't go there if you are watching what you eat üòÄ. We also got the biscuits for appetizers. For entrees we got crab cakes, half rack of ribs and the mixed BBQ platter. All very good, the ribs were very done and would easily compare well with the stuff you get in the South. We also got the mac-n-cheese as a side, decent but didn't stand out. For dessert we got the bread pudding and creme brulee, both very good. The latter especially so! The service was ok, thought it was a bit detached, didn't see the enthusiasm. Good dinner nonetheless, highly recommend."
770,The Farmers Union,"Fantastic and tasty food, I loved the character this spot has, and the cashiers were welcoming. I will definitely visit here next time."
771,The Farmers Union,"Good food, a little cold outside but the heaters helped. Also, our server was amazing, super nice and attentive."
772,The Farmers Union,This spot offers great service and tasty food. The best restaurant around here. The drinks and food came out fast and the rates were reasonable. I recommend this place.
773,The Farmers Union,"Love eating here! I had the impossible burger and a margarita. The mushroom cigars are a delicious appetizer, but they're pretty heavy, like there's a lot of oil in them, so best to share among 3-4 people."
774,The Farmers Union,Awesome place! Friendly staff. Really good food. Amazing selection of beer on tap. Can only recommend this place! Photo shows the brisket with hot coleslaw.
775,The Farmers Union,Grass fed burger was very good. Outdoor seating is available.
776,The Farmers Union,Came here after a Shark's game and the place was packed but we got seated quite quickly. This place serves typically pub food but quite tasty. Competent and friendly service too.
777,The Farmers Union,"The location, the environment, and the staff is really good! I wish we could enjoy the beautiful room inside as well. Nevertheless, with all the problems right now, shout out to Marina, hosted us the best she could!"
778,The Farmers Union,I have been here so many times and I am never disappointed. Here is my latest trip's review!
779,The Farmers Union,"What I ordered: A large Caesar salad and a large bowl of tomato soup. The Caesar salad had excellent flavor and the croutons are very gourmet, they aren't the standard squares you get from other restaurants. However, the lettuce that you get is not chopped up, it is strips of a leaf of lettuce which I had to cut up in order to eat. The tomato soup is excellent, it has a little bit of a pureed texture which is enjoyable to eat because it's not so liquidy and bland. They also give you a slice of French bread to dip into the soup which I thought was a nice touch."
780,The Farmers Union,"Tips: Parking is very easy, as you can park in the San Pedro garage. Farmer's Union also gives out parking validations to this parking garage. Also, having been here many times before, the fried chicken sandwich is out of this world!"
781,The Farmers Union,"Great decor, helpful staff, and a variety of modern American and European food options. I really enjoyed the sausage plate and my wife loved the shrimp linguini. Definitely need to try the bread pudding for dessert."
782,The Farmers Union,Great drinks. Great food. Good atmosphere.
783,The Farmers Union,Best salad I've ever had. Union Salad. Amazing salad. However the ceviche was by far the worst civeche I've ever had. It was a very polar experience. Great service though. They need to get rid of that civeche though.
784,The Farmers Union,Came here for Sunday brunch and it was pretty good!  I had the steak and eggs with a dark and stormy since I love rum.  Great service and the food came out relatively quick.  Will be back!
785,The Farmers Union,"Excelent customer service Basir is so professional, Kind and he is totaly different than other sales person he never pushes and the whole process was very smooth"
786,The Farmers Union,Great food with lots of beers on tap.
787,The Farmers Union,"I love the food here. Such great quality, fast friendly service. Great date spot!"
788,The Farmers Union,Being back in San Jose for a Sharks game we took our usual walk downtown to find somewhere new to experience for dinner. Tonight's choice turned out to be The Farmers Union on the corner of Santa Clara and San Pedro streets.
789,The Farmers Union,"Framers Union has a spacious dining area with a large full bar. They also have semi private dining alcoves that are cozy, but not cramped with huge windows that give you an open feeling. If that isn't enough room for you try the upstairs dining, over looking the bar, or outside sidewalk dining for people watching."
790,The Farmers Union,We were seated quickly and our drink orders taken. Tonight's server was Jomuckha who was as professional as she was attractive. Tonight we choose to have an appetizer of the dungeness crab cakes. They're served with citrus vinaigrette and cajun remoulade. The cakes were moist with just the right complement of spices and onion.
791,The Farmers Union,"There were 3 of us in tonight's group. Our entree selections tonight were the beer batter fish and chips. The true cod fish were serve hot and flaky with Union secret sauce, sea salt, and Kennebec fries. ($18)"
792,The Farmers Union,"Lamb burger served with tzatziki spread, red pepper feta cheese, dirty fries, and all the fixin's. ($17) The tzatziki spread (Yogurt, cumber, lemon, spices) lettuce, pickles, and tomato help with the dryness of the lamb."
793,The Farmers Union,"Grilled flat iron steak with dirty fries, Fresno chili chimichurri, and a fried egg. $24 This was my selection for the evening. Ordered medium, served perfect, and delicious."
794,The Farmers Union,"The pluses for tonight: the openness of the dining area, Jomuckha's spot on service, perfectly cooked steak and cod, and generous portions."
795,The Farmers Union,"The minuses for tonight: 2 of our orders came with dirty fries. We obviously were served the bottom of the pan. The fries were served cold and saturated in their dirty spice. Jomuckha was apologetic and removed the price from our bill, but minus 1 star for lack of attention to detail."
796,The Farmers Union,"All in all I would recommend The Farmers Union. I loved the location, service, and dinning room and enjoyed the uniquely different twists on their menu items."
797,The Farmers Union,As always please like this review if it was helpful to you. As a local guide your likes are important to me.
798,The Farmers Union,Food ok service ok patio is great
799,The Farmers Union,"Overall: The service here is amazing. The food is nothing to rave about. It gets the job done. With all the competition in the area, I would recommend that they change up the menu."
800,The Farmers Union,"Food: The food here is okay. I had the beef brisket, which was great. The BBQ sauce compliments the brisket very well. The side baked beans were delicious. The potato salad, was unique and tasted fresh."
801,The Farmers Union,I was also able to try the salmon. It was just okay. Nothing special about it. They give you a lot of beans with your fish and I mean a lot of beans. The sauce that was with it was average as well.
802,The Farmers Union,I tried their beer soda. It was good. The grapefruit was okay.
803,The Farmers Union,Service: Our server was nice. She came by every so often to check on us. The other workers were nice. One worker was nice enough to actually get me a validation when I asked earlier. It shows that they care about their customers here.
804,The Farmers Union,Pricing: Main dishes will set you up fro $23-$30 dollars. Appetizers will cost you $10-$15. Non alcoholic drinks go for $5.
805,The Farmers Union,"Ambience: It is very loud here. If you are on a date, I would recommend going elsewhere. This place appears to cater to large groups. I had to yell at my significant other most of the time. The place does have a warm feel to it. Plenty of items to look at the wall. At no point did I feel like the place was too confine in space."
806,The Farmers Union,The bar is located on the bottom floor in the middle. It's not a hot spot to be at if you are only here for a drink. I would going down San Pedro for more bar options.
807,The Farmers Union,Parking: They validate your parking for 2 hours at the Parking garage SP+. You can also park on the street if you find a spot.
808,The Farmers Union,"Everything was well made and seasoned, and our server was super helpful and patient! I would recommend."
809,The Farmers Union,"Very nice place to relax have a cocktail and apitizers. Staff is great, masks and social distancing is good."
810,The Farmers Union,This place has a good vibe and a decent menu. I had the pork chop and it was nicely cooked. I also had some of the wings which were good and very saucy and the meatballs were also wonderful.
811,The Farmers Union,"The bartender was nice enough to pour me a flight from their extensive beer menu. I had two IPAs, a PB&j sour and a stout with maple and coffee. The selection left little to be desired."
812,The Farmers Union,Everyone else in my party appeared to also enjoy their food and we were all glad we went there. Parking can be tough in this area but there are a few garages close by where you can park around 10 bucks.
813,The Farmers Union,Great food and Beers friendly staff üëç Jesus the bar tender is awesome!!!
814,The Farmers Union,"This is my third time here. I only eat Beef Brisket here because is delicious! If you like COLD beer (YOU GOT THAT RIGHT, I SAID COLD) you are in the right place. I finally found a place with very cold beer and great list. Two thumbs up!!!"
815,The Farmers Union,Excellent beer selection and food menu... great decor and atmosphere. Completely full on a Wednesday evening (also a sharks game night) but staff was excellent and had a great experience
816,The Farmers Union,"Delicious lunch, great customer service and awesome options. Will be back for dinner and a cocktail."
817,The Farmers Union,Nice atmosphere and really nice people manning the bar with great tasting bangers and mash... plus a delicious caramel bread pudding made for a great visit.
818,The Farmers Union,"Would recommend doing a salad and a table share of the appetizers, all the food we had was excellent.  The bread pudding dessert, was excellent.  A must try after a great meal."
819,The Farmers Union,"Amazing service, very friendly and accommodating staff. The portions were large and the food tasted great. I'd highly recommend the fries - just the right amount of crispy and some of the best I've ever had."
820,The Farmers Union,"Good food and drinks. The old fashioned cocktail is especially good. Couple favorites are the crabcakes, sausage platter and lamb burger. Downside is poor acoustics and it can get really loud at times."
821,The Farmers Union,A great addition to downtown San Jose‚Äôs food scene! Everything we‚Äôve had here has been delicious and full of thoughtful ingredients. A popular date night location for my household.
822,The Farmers Union,"There was a wide assortment of better-than-pub food, and a wider choice of beers. The food was served very quickly and my party enjoyed their plates."
823,The Farmers Union,I got the brisket. It was really good. But I‚Äôm not a BBQ aficionado so take that with a grain of salt (the brisket was salty enough).
824,The Farmers Union,The room is very loud but we were in the shave under the stairs where we were a bit sheltered. That was ideal for a large party.
825,The Farmers Union,I will be back.
826,The Farmers Union,"For dinner on weekends its better to have res. After 10ish more open seating. Great spot to catch dinner b4 show 3 long blocks away, winter fair, and before hitting the local bar scene. Private booths, large open upstairs as well. Friendly staff. Excellent drinks , just okay food. Pretty presentation. Dishes where dropped so much the bar patrons keep clapping! Its a fun place to start your weekend partying. My girlfriend had the salmon plate, she said it was yummy 4 her tummy. I had the iron skirt steak w fried egg on top. Very cute but lacking seasoning. Hip vibe and clean gastropub."
827,The Farmers Union,Great atmosphere food and drinks. I recommend the Ricky Bobby cocktail if you're into Gin as well as the Fish and Chips!
828,The Farmers Union,"Nice food, good service, great selection of beer."
829,The Farmers Union,"Food was good, wasn't expecting to get BBQ here but tried it. The habanero slaw was awesome (vinegar) as were the collards. Didn't dig the corn bread (no salt or sugar and too dense) and it was a huge portion of brisket but also lots of fat. Service was ok, not super. Beer selection was great. Crowded."
830,The Farmers Union,Decent place. Good burgers and beer. Okay cocktails. This place was great 6 months ago but has went a little downhill since. Still a good place though.
831,The Farmers Union,"Steak, fries, egg and chimmichurri sauce... Great dish. Good time, good beer selection."
832,The Farmers Union,"Stopped in for dinner while in San Jose for business. The menu description hit a lot if the right notes for me, and they also had a fine selection of wine and drinks. But, as in most restaurants, they were a let down in the low or no sugar drink area."
833,The Farmers Union,"The menu for all on one page but had a great variety. We had the meatballs and the IPA Fondue as appetizers. The meatballs were fairly good, but the fondue was much stronger overall. I could have eaten it all night."
834,The Farmers Union,"They had a section ""From the Smoker"" on the menu, and being a slow cooking aficionado, I had to give the ribs a shot. Sadly, as is in the case in a restaurant like this they were a let down. Some bites were good, the sauce had a nice flavor, but the ribs overall were far too dry. It's impossible to dry out ribs of they were truly from the smoker, and they had the feel of mostly grilled ribs to me, which I do not like."
835,The Farmers Union,"I still think the overall experience was good, and I would eat there again. I would just go with a burger or something in lieu of the barbecue."
836,The Farmers Union,"Great hangout with vast selection of beers on tap and delicious pub food.  I've only come by during a weekend afternoon (opens 4pm), with friends or solo, but consider one of the go-to places in downtown San Jose.  I recommend highly."
837,The Farmers Union,"I've dined here many times and have never been disappointed.  Great food, comfortable atmosphere, and excellent service.  They've recently added Sunday brunch and the breakfast is fantastic... certainly the best in downtown SJ."
838,The Farmers Union,"One of our favorite downtown San Jose restaurants.  The Farm to table style is fresh and high-quality. Their version of the Cobb salad is delicious with chicken, almonds and dates. The lamb burgers are huge and yummy and served with tzatziki."
839,The Farmers Union,Had a wonderful experience at The Farmers Union for my sister wedding rehearsal dinner. The food was amazing! I had the salmon with lentil rice pilaf and grilled veggies. The service was great (Thanks Mike!) as well as the overall ambiance. If I still lived in the bay area I would definitely return with friends. Thanks for making my sister night a memorable one!
840,The Farmers Union,Large portions which all ingredients are sourced locally. Very tasty food & a great atmosphere. Would definately recommend.
841,The Farmers Union,The Blackened Chicken sandwich is fire. In fact all four of us enjoyed each of our varying meals. Will gladly come back any time.
842,The Farmers Union,"Really great food. Good vibes. I have been to the place twice now. Once in 2017 and now in 2019. Had a great evening both the times. Indians just one suggestion have a very mild beer, their strong beers tend to be very bitter, u might not enjoy them"
843,The Farmers Union,I should have took a photo of the food but it was too good to interrupt. Quick and friendly service. I can see why they have a lot of good reviews.
844,The Farmers Union,"Really enjoyed our night at The Farmers Union for our anniversary dinner. Great beer selection and we enjoyed the ambiance of the place. I'm looking forward to coming back before a sharks game or for another night out. We tried the fondue, the chorizo poutine, and the Rosemary mac and cheese. Both the fondue and the Mac and cheese were really good. The chorizo poutine was bold in it's flavors, but it was a bit much. I'd gladly return, but would like to try other menu items."
845,The Farmers Union,"The Farmers Union is a sold downtown eatery. I'd give it a 4.5 rating if I could, but I can't, and let's be real, not much is a five, right? Menu is down South, down home, but done with a bit of an upscale touch. Great place to grab a cocktail too. Fairly priced all around. Look to give it a try when you're in the area."
846,The Farmers Union,"Solid selection of on-tap craft beers and a decent food menu. Service was efficient, and portion sizes are handsome--better value than I anticipated initially. I would return."
847,The Farmers Union,"What can I say? The staff are awesome, the food is excellent, and the drinks are some of the best in town. Shout out to Dante for the excellent service."
848,The Farmers Union,"Hip place to eat, looks like it gets busy so I would recommend a reservation. Our group walked in and ended up waiting a lot longer than told, but it was all good because they have a fantastic bar and friendly staff. If I'm ever in the area again I will for sure be stopping by for dinner."
849,The Farmers Union,A friend and I had dinner here recently before a Sharks game.  The place is always packed on game nights and you definitely need to make a reservation.  It does get loud in the place when its full so you sometimes have a hard time hearing each other.  But its not too bad.
850,The Farmers Union,"I started with the Moscow Mule - sobieski vodka, angostura bitters, ginger beer.  This was really good.  Nice tart ginger flavor."
851,The Farmers Union,"For entree, I had the Beer Battered Fish & Chips - true cod, union secret sauce, sea salt, kennebec fries.  I have it before and its always good.  The fish was crispy outside and soft inside, nice a flaky.  Not greasy at all.  Good tarter dipping sauce.  And love the fries.  Also crispy outside, soft inside."
852,The Farmers Union,Overall another good meal at Farmers Union.
853,The Farmers Union,Celebrated my birthday at this cool restaurant.  Like it
854,The Farmers Union,"Excellent location and great vibe. The food was great and it was a nice place to watch the Sharks game. Also, our server ""Downtown"" Dante was excellent- attentive without lingering. We'll definitely be back."
855,The Farmers Union,"Sunday Brunch.  Excellent portions, fresh ingredients and a solid mainstream selection of things to taste.  Food was timely and tell prepared.  My only knock is the service continues to be relatively amateur.   If you are an easy going group, hit this spot for brunch, you'll be happy you did."
856,The Farmers Union,"Wow! Our group started with the IPA and Cheddar Fondue and Max & Cheese for an appetizer. had the the brisket with the habanero Cole slaw and potato salad.  Everything was fresh, flavorful and had perfect presentation. The server also gave me a spot on beer recommendation, based on my tastes."
857,El Jalapeno Rojo,"It was good, quick, and surprisingly more affordable than any other taco/burrito place I've been to. I got a super carne asada burrito and it was delicious. Got some rice, bean and cheese burritos for the kids and they enjoyed them. Also, they're veggie burrito had refried beans, which my hubby said was good too. Will definitely be back and try some other stuff on their menu."
858,El Jalapeno Rojo,.the best enchildas and it's worth the wait!!!
859,El Jalapeno Rojo,Good food with fast drive through service!
860,El Jalapeno Rojo,"I take my nephew here maybe once a month. He loves the Chile Relleno plate and Quesidilla with carnitas. And, can't forget aqua de horchata. Yummy!"
861,El Jalapeno Rojo,A bit of a wait... But freshly made anything is worth the wait!!!
862,El Jalapeno Rojo,"It was good, quick, and surprisingly more affordable than any other taco/burrito place I've been to. I got a super carne asada burrito and it was delicious. Got some rice, bean and cheese burritos for the kids and they enjoyed them. Also, they're veggie burrito had refried beans, which my hubby said was good too. Will definitely be back and try some other stuff on their menu."
863,El Jalapeno Rojo,Pretty good place for quick tacos and Quesadilla. Love their Avocado Salsa
864,El Jalapeno Rojo,Pastor was yummy. The pineapple water could be more flavorful. Will be back for the sopes
865,El Jalapeno Rojo,"I got a super burrito - asada was tender, salsas were good, rice was fluffy and flavorful (would prefer no rice at all, but it seems to be the standard). But there wasn't any avocado at all and a weak amount of sour cream"
866,El Jalapeno Rojo,"Food is good, open late and a drive thru !! I would give this place five stars but the horchata taste instant."
867,El Jalapeno Rojo,It's a great place great customer service and there drive thru is fast I love it
868,El Jalapeno Rojo,Thier carne asada super nachos are the best!  I love it
869,El Jalapeno Rojo,"I take my nephew here maybe once a month. He loves the Chile Relleno plate and Quesidilla with carnitas. And, can't forget aqua de horchata. Yummy!"
870,El Jalapeno Rojo,Love their wet burritos.. the sauce  is deelish
871,El Jalapeno Rojo,For the price and speed of food. It's the best. But I can tell they have some off days.
872,El Jalapeno Rojo,This a great place to get tacos from. My family and best friend love this place.
873,El Jalapeno Rojo,Their food is always so fresh. Love their pastor anything and everything. Horchata is some of the best in the Bay. Chicken flautas are always delish.
874,El Jalapeno Rojo,"The food is amazing. You look at the place and think ""Drive Thru Taqueria?"" The Super Tacos are so worth it."
875,El Jalapeno Rojo,The food was delicious.  Made fresh while we waited and still nice and hot when we got home. Also the drive through option was excellent!  We will go backüëç
876,El Jalapeno Rojo,The tacos are fire!
877,El Jalapeno Rojo,"I have had the burritos here years ago and couldn't remember if I liked them or not, so I decided to try tacos this time. Omg."
878,El Jalapeno Rojo,"I was a little unimpressed by their appearance at first, because it looked like they didn't put enough cilantro and onions. After taking a bite though I realized that maybe I usually just like cilantro and onions because the meat inst as good at other places? The asada here is insanely good and maybe the best I've ever had. The carnitas was also amazing. I tried shredded chicken and pastor too, which were great, but they did get me excited like the asada."
879,El Jalapeno Rojo,Food is delicious here. Quick & friendly service üëçüèº
880,El Jalapeno Rojo,"Awesome food, great service, and they always get your order right! Also open late."
881,El Jalapeno Rojo,"I LOVE THE CUSTOMER SERVICE.... THESE COOL PEOPLE SPEAK ENGLISH AND SPANISH.... THEIR BURRITOS AND TORTAS ARE SO GOOD. I RECOMMEND THE TASTY TORTAS..... THE DRIVE THROUGH IS QUICK AND THE EATING ARRANGEMENT OUTSIDE OF THIS SMALL PLACE IS A GOOD AREA TO EAT.... PEACEFUL AND QUIET WITH A SCENERY THAT IS WELL LIKED... HAVEN'T TASTED THE SHRIMP BUT I BET IT IS VERY GOOD. SO YOU GOT TO GIVE IT A TRY PEOPLE... TEENS AND KIDS ATLEAST ONCE. THE LOCATION IS IN A SECLUDED AREA BUT MANAGABLE FROM DOWNTOWN SAN JOSE, CA. RIGHT OFF THE FREEWAY AND DOWN THE STREET FROM SAN JOSE STATE AND HOTELS. SO TWO THUMBS UP FROM DRACO'S DANIEL'S BEHALF__________"
882,El Jalapeno Rojo,Good food with a convenient drive through
883,El Jalapeno Rojo,Foods always good wait time isn't crazy..
884,El Jalapeno Rojo,Nice environment and super personal service. The food was fresh and delicious. Will definitely recommend this spot to friends. Fair rates and big portions. Keep up the great work.
885,El Jalapeno Rojo,A bit of a wait... But freshly made anything is worth the wait!!!

888,El Jalapeno Rojo,"Don't come here expecting fancy digs, exquisite ambiance or table service."

898,El Jalapeno Rojo,I always order tacos and rice. This place never disappoints. The meat is always tender and flavored just rightüëå
899,El Jalapeno Rojo,The BEST MEXICAN FOOD fast friendly service but only when 2nd shift crew is working the morning workers food doesn't taste as good so it's best to go in the evening

901,El Jalapeno Rojo,Good value for money. They have good outdoor seating area for a quick bite. Friendly staff.

907,El Jalapeno Rojo,The best red salsa by far . Most mex. Food is great but this place stands above the rest because of the homemade red salsa . Sooooooooo gooooooooood . Keep making it the same. Consistency is the key . And please bring back the flan !!!!
908,El Jalapeno Rojo,Good taqueria with legit hot salsa with flavor.  Definitely found a good spot for a Mexican food fix.

910,El Jalapeno Rojo,I ordered a carne asada regular burrito. I was impressed with the size of the burrito because I did not get a super I was expecting a smaller burrito but it was actually quite large. I finished half of it for lunch and then have for dinner. The little sauce containers they gave were a little bit small but they're hot sauce is really good. They put a shade over there seating area which is nice but I did not sit there this time around. Quality food at a more than reasonable price. Thumbs-up from me.
911,El Jalapeno Rojo,"Every time I come here, it's delicious! Never had any complaints or no mess ups on my orders. My to go place when I'm in Downtown San Jose for Mexican food!"
912,El Jalapeno Rojo,Good food for cheap. Great combo!
913,El Jalapeno Rojo,Best Chile Rellenos in town. It's mainly a drive thru.
914,El Jalapeno Rojo,This place is awesome its super good espcially their Fish Tacos and Quesodillaa. It has a drive through which is awesome.

921,El Jalapeno Rojo,One of the only taqueria's in San Jose that I love good tortillas! good meat! good gosh let's eat!
922,El Jalapeno Rojo,"I like this place it has  drive-thru. If you want to get something fast or have kids and you don't want to get them down and waste  time, this has been my place to go. Food quality is good but a little pricy. The only thing that I don't like is the customer service from the lady that's always at the window through the drive-thru. She seems like she's always serious never get a smile from her, she seems like she is not happy with her job. They have  a sign that says be nice or leave for costumers but I thinks the lady on the drive thru window should follow what it says‚Ä¶"
923,El Jalapeno Rojo,"I love this family run joint. Great food quality, even if they dont have La Victoria's orange sauce.  Always friendly service and tasty Salsa Verde means I'll keep coming back."
924,El Jalapeno Rojo,Tacos are really GOOD ! Perfect for a good meal that ain‚Äôt too expensive Highly recommend only thing is they give you only like 3 sauces for 8 tacos and they get mad when you ask for more.
925,El Jalapeno Rojo,"I‚Äôve been a customer for 8 years now, good food for decent prices."
926,El Jalapeno Rojo,This place has been one of my favorites places to get a big hardy burrito that will fill you up. Great place & service at reasonable prices. Love it.üòã

943,El Jalapeno Rojo,Drive thru Mexican is amazing! Shrimp burritos always on point!‚ô°
944,El Jalapeno Rojo,"This is a super convenient drive-through serving good Mexican food, fast.  Had the Chile Verde and the Lengua (beef tongue) in ""regular"" burritos which have rice, beans, meat and optional onions and cilantro).  Both were delicious.  They also have a read and a green salsa as accompaniments.  I preferred the red but both were quite good."
945,El Jalapeno Rojo,Good Mexican food and friendly staff. And the fact it's a drive-thru and they take cards makes it even better!
946,El Jalapeno Rojo,My favorite taqueria in San Jose. I love this place. It was something else before and I can't spell so I won't mention it but still great quality. I love their tacos. Asada with everything!! The salsa is bomb. I'm picky when it comes to rice but I live their Spanish rice. Everything is really good : )
947,El Jalapeno Rojo,One of my absolute fav Mexican spots!
948,El Jalapeno Rojo,Excellent Mexican food with good size portion's and a drive thru.
949,El Jalapeno Rojo,"It's a good place to eat, has a drive thru or you can sit down and eat outside when your eating something spicy with a cool breeze cooling you downüòÅ. The service is great, the staff are very friendly makes me want to go back for the salsa..yum,yum."
950,El Jalapeno Rojo,I like the taco over there. My to go place for light bites. The drive thru is convenient and the staff is friendly

953,El Jalapeno Rojo,A very nice place to get some decent tacos to go.
954,El Jalapeno Rojo,"Great food at a reasonable price, give them a try! Very limited parking, and tight fit drive-thru. But man, what a burrito!"
955,El Jalapeno Rojo,"Best chicken burritos this side of the Pecos. Seriously. Not cheap, but worth it. Make the effort to check it out."
956,El Jalapeno Rojo,Good breakfast burrios and fast drive thru service
957,El Jalapeno Rojo,Carne asada is always on point and the staff very friendly!
958,El Jalapeno Rojo,"I enjoy picking up ""to go"" taqueria food after a long day of work through their drive threw window. I always get the chicken flautas entree, garlic shrimp tacos and the cheese enchiladas -they are the best options so far. I would give it a 5 star rating if their carne asada was better. But I still like coming here when I'm on the go its delicious every time."
959,El Jalapeno Rojo,Big portions for a drive through restaurant. I love the wet burrito from here.
960,El Jalapeno Rojo,"Consistently good and really affordable.  Great flavor, especially in their chicken, carnitas, and salsa Verde."
961,El Jalapeno Rojo,The food was excellent and the staff were very kind and considerate! My daughter and I had the asada quesadilla and Chile verde fries. We were both very satisfied and it was plenty of food for us to share and take some leftovers home.
962,Giordano's,"This is a 4 star, kid-friendly, vegetarian-friendly place that serves Italian food and pizza which also serves alcohol."
963,Giordano's,"Very good pizza, one of the best I've had. BBQ bacon chicken deep dish. Only knock was that it didn't come out piping hot like I'd like. Just kinda settled and warm."
964,Giordano's,Thin Crust Super Veggie Pizza ‚ù§
965,Giordano's,"Fantastic place to eat! The deep dish is great. The wait for it is around 40 minutes, be ready for that, but know it is because they are making the pizza on the spot, and it will be fresh when you get it. Had a good time."
966,Giordano's,It's amazing but the only thing is waiting time. We were 3 and we waited for 35 minutes for the table. After I got the table if I order deep dish u are waiting another 45 minutes to eat the pizza. Is it worth to wait definitely
967,Giordano's,"The cheesecurds here are amazing!! The deep dish pizza, which is what I came to experience, was quite tasty as well! It was almost like an upside down pizza (crust still on the bottom) baked in a cheesecake pan. I loved it, and as the self proclaimed foodie I am (üíÅüèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è), I would absolutely recommend coming here üëåüëåüëå"
968,Giordano's,"When in Chicago, you have to try deep dish pizza. Super filling although it took some time to be ready.  Worth the wait though."
969,Giordano's,We had an amazing time in this place. We liked the superb atmosphere and the menu. The waiters were very attentive. I‚Äôm happy we eventually managed to try this restaurant.
970,Giordano's,"The calamari was perfect. We ordered the small meat & more deep dish and took a few slices home. Armando, our waiter, was the best. Quick service, offered a recommendation and checked on us frequently without interrupting dinner. Overall great night eating that classic Chicago deep dish pizza."
971,Giordano's,"Wow the best, delicious deep dish pizza, I have never tasted in Chicago, must try it, superb taste."
972,Giordano's,"On a trip to Chicago, we were looking for quintessential Chicago deep dish pizza."
973,Giordano's,"We were looking to find a place near the Magnificent Mile where our hotel was located.  We found Giordano's.  The pizza was excellent, Chicago pizza and not overly greasy, either. The service was pretty good too."
974,Giordano's,"I‚Äôm so glad we were referred to this place, as the customer service and food was delicious!  Although we were unable to eat inside, they made outside dining a great experience. They have heaters at each individual table and the manager frequently checked on us to ensure we had a great experience. We got the parmesan crusted spinach mushroom deep dish with alfredo sauce and it was cooked to perfection. üòã"
975,Giordano's,"My mouth is still watering from Dave's. First and foremost, my and girlfriend LOVE chicken sandwiches, and Dave's is by far one of thee best we've ever had. The price is reasonable, the portions are perfect and the service is always super nice and helpful."
976,Giordano's,"We've been there twice now, both late at night, and only once was the line longer than 30 minutes, but it moves pretty quickly."
977,Giordano's,"We got the 2 chicken sliders with fries and two chicken tenders with fries. The chicken was crispy on the outside, juicy on the inside."
978,Giordano's,"Pizza was delicious!   Second visit to Chicago but my husband's first.  He had to experience this meat  deliciousness!  I was disappointed only had take out, thats not Giordanos fault at all.  Hopefully next time we can eat on the restaurant hot out of the oven."
979,Giordano's,"Absolutely amazing place, great and delicious stuffed pizza, very nice. Super recommended."
980,Giordano's,"Amazing food and service! Due to recent Covid restrictions, all dining was patio only. It was pretty cold the evening we ate there but the staff was very accommodating to keep heaters going! We ordered deep dish pizza and it was the best crust!! We will definitely be back."
981,Giordano's,Tasty deep dish pizza. We also tried the calamari and the tomato basil soup. Everything was delicious!
982,Giordano's,"Many people recommended me this restaurant and it's famous deep dish pizza and, actually, I was not disappointed. I tried the Chicago Classic Small Deep Dish Pizza and I have to say that is not small at all, I think 3 people can eat with one of this. Delicious stuffed pizza, great service and nice atmosphere. A must to go in Chicago downtown. Recommended."
983,Giordano's,"Very good pizza, one of the best I've had. BBQ bacon chicken deep dish. Only knock was that it didn't come out piping hot like I'd like. Just kinda settled and warm."
984,Giordano's,I love this place... everytime I come to downtown Chicago. Its a must eat place for me Everything I have tried so far has been amazing... From the pizza to the sandwiches U can't go wrong with this place. On the costly side but we'll worth it for sure I hope u give them a try and lik this place as much as I do
985,Giordano's,Best pizza I've ever had. This pizza definitely ends the longstanding NYC/CHI pizza debate for me. Generous pizza. Great wings.
986,Giordano's,"Daniela was a fantastic server and waitress/bartender, went above and beyond to make sure we had our drinks and appetizers extremely quickly. Appetizers were great and the pizza was the best I‚Äôve had in Chicago. Would absolutely recommend this place to anyone."
987,Giordano's,Gave me great customer service above and beyond what was required. They opened the shop early to allow me to buy some frozen pizzas before I had to leave town. They were awesome too when we baked them up.
988,Giordano's,If you are in Chicago and don‚Äôt eat here you are crazy!!! This is one of the best deep dish pizzas I have ever eaten.
989,Giordano's,Staff is very friendly and restaurant is clean. They are also very busy and tell you up front deep dish is up to a 45 min wait. It is worth it and you won‚Äôt be disappointed. We are definitely eating here again when we return next month!
990,Giordano's,This is my favorite pizza place to visit in Chicago. We got right in but it does take about 45 to cook a deep dish. We shared a medium between 4 people and still had left overs!
991,Giordano's,Nice place and very good atmosphere. We enjoyed one of the best Chicago pizza. Very good quality and good prices.
992,Giordano's,Excellent service. Enjoyed the thin crust and Chicago style pizza. Both were excellent.
993,Giordano's,Best deep dish pizza in the world. Seriously there is no comparison. We have this pizza flown in...its that good.
994,Giordano's,This place was worth the wait. Pizza was very good and something different from what we‚Äôre used to. Great experience.
995,Giordano's,"Delicious. It came highly recommended, and it did not disappoint. There was a wait, but that's to be expected considering how busy it was. We sat at the bar, and service was great. Had individual portions of the bbq chicken deep dish and classic pizzas. Finished with the skillet cookie. Delicious!"
996,Giordano's,"First time going to Chicago and heard all about Giordano‚Äôs so ofc we had to try it. Wait time was a bit long, it was a Friday night in early August. Seating outside available and some seating inside but only less than half capacity because of social distancing."
997,Giordano's,"Pizza did take about 40 minutes to come out, but they were busy. Staff is very friendly and accommodating. Kept refilling our ice tea without having to ask."
998,Giordano's,"The deep dish pie was pretty good. Lots of cheese and thick. Wish it had more sauce thou. Otherwise, great pizza and great Chicago experience."
999,Giordano's,"What an amazing Pizzeria! I have not tasted a better pizza anywhere else, And even though we had to wait outside, it was well worth the wait!"
1000,Giordano's,"Obviously this is a staple not only if you‚Äôre visiting Chicago but if you‚Äôve never had a deep dish pizza like myself. This is a prime location if your on the Mag Mile and want to take a slight break to eat. This place is huge but I opted to sit at the bar since it was full service and had the small perk of having a outlet to charge my phone. Be prepared to wait as all pizzas are made to order and takes around 30-40 minutes minimum. To kill time, I ordered the cheesy bread, which was to die for! I order the small super veggie deep dish that was clearly enough for two people to snack on. I merely ate one slice and I was full! The bartender was super friendly and attentive to refilling my drinks without any hesitation. There are plenty of TVs to catch an sporting events while you wait also. A must if you‚Äôre ever in town!"
1001,Giordano's,"The best pasta restaurant in the city! I love their Bolognese here and they serve pizza, too. They have the friendliest staff and servers. Their pastaio was very funny and bubbly, too! The place was very comfy and cozy. The next time I'll visit here is I will be bringing my family, sure they will love their pasta!"
1002,Giordano's,"The best pizza. Anywhere. Better than the ""other guy"" in the Chicago area. Have been known to drive 5 hours round trip just to get this pizza when really craving it. Even the frozen pizza that you bake at home is phenomenal. Could not pick a better spot for pizza while in Chicago."
1003,Giordano's,Delicious DISH PIZZA! Even with the outdoor dining in windy Chicago I enjoyed my meal.
1004,Giordano's,What awesome food! Pleasant atmosphere and best deep dish pizza I've ever had. I always make a point to visit Giordanos whenever in Chicago.   First time here at Giordano‚Äôs. Had the supreme deep dish and sampler appetizer. Wonderful meal! Although appetizer was cold. If you haven‚Äôt had deep dish before...we had a medium which was 6 slices so we each had 2 slices which was more than enough. Went early for lunch to beat the rush. Can‚Äôt wait to go back!
1005,Giordano's,"Best pizza. Nothing like having it fresh baked or even delivered to your home across this great nation for a treat. Owner is personable and truly grateful for his costumers. Truly felt grateful he went out of his way to talk to 2 nurses from California wanting to visit his place. Kindness, and love for your work truly goes across all spectrums"
1006,Giordano's,Waitress was so sweet and although it was busy we didn't wait very long for our appetizer and pizza. We had two slices leftover after sharing a medium amongst three people. Come hungry!
1007,Giordano's,Best wings... love the flavor (T. Lime Wings)... 2  different toppings for the Deep Dish üòç so yummy üòã (BUT too greasy)... Medium size deep dish is enough for 6 people (a slice for each one)
1008,Giordano's,"Fantastic place to eat! The deep dish is great. The wait for it is around 40 minutes, be ready for that, but know it is because they are making the pizza on the spot, and it will be fresh when you get it. Had a good time."
1009,Giordano's,They have some of  Chicago's best deep fish.  Definitely top notch  Had great service at this location.   Friendly staff and clean restaurant.  Authentic Chicago!!
1010,Giordano's,Pizza at this place - super tasty. Excellent spot to spend time alone or talk business. Looking forward to a return trip. The place has an awesome atmosphere. Food is similar to a place in San Francisco I loved.
1011,Giordano's,Pizza and the scene here is above par. service is awesome even when they are busy. looking forward to returning with my friends. prices are appropriate. reminds me of a place in new york i liked to visit.
1012,Giordano's,"Definitely the best deep dish pizza we had in Chicago, from the sauce to the toppings to the cheese and crust. Everything was phenomenal."
1013,Giordano's,"My nephews made the drive up from Texas (for fun and try to Chicago-style pizza!).  We were the first there on July 4th. The server, Sonya, was incredibly sweet and quick to check if we needed anything. She even agreed to take a picture of the four of us. One of my nephews asked the manager if he were the owner. The guy laughed and said something about no, he'd be on his yacht instead of talking to us on the Fourth of July. He talked to us for a few minutes. My nephews told him about having driven up from Texas just for their pizza. He explained that he gets that a lot. One party from Kentucky was there yesterday. He'd asked them if they had great pizza in Kentucky. One guy replied ""Until now, I thought we did!"" The pizza was truly incredible.  When I first saw it, I was thinking it was small for the four of us. No - we even took a slice home to go! It will ruin you for any other pizza. The meat, cheese, and crust ratio is incredible. The crust itself just adds to the flavor. It is honestly a fantastic pizza. The service and atmosphere was top-notch. It was worth a drive up from Texas - though I only came from Lafayette. I told my wife we should drive up again sometime. To which my daughter is in total agreement!"
1014,Giordano's,"First things first, the main reason any one really goes to Giordano's is for their deep dish pizza.  This location happened to be a mere block away from our hotel so it was convenient enough to walk to."
1015,Giordano's,"We came around 3:00 PM on a Saturday and had to wait approximately 15-20 minutes to be seated.  Once seated and ordered, it takes about 45 minutes just for the pizza to be completed.  So we ordered a single deep dish and a salad and waited, and waited, and waited.  Once the pizza did arrive, it was a bit smaller than I had anticipated, but I do take the blame their as the waitress had explained the personal size to us multiple times.  The deep dish is very good though, I've never really had true deep dish and was pleasantly surprised by how good it was.  I would still prefer NY pizza over deep dish, but for the hate I've heard over deep dish, I must say it's pretty unwarranted."
1016,Giordano's,"Was a bit upset that they didn't offer thin slice pizza as a personal size and could only get one as a small, which is meant to feed two."
1017,Giordano's,I had the lunch special which was tasty. The waiter was friendly and attentive. 45 minute wait for deep dish pizza but for the personal size lunch pizzas they‚Äôre already prepared. The dough on the bottom was a bit gooey which is my main complaint. I left surprisingly full.
1018,Giordano's,"1st time having a deep dish.  It didn't disappoint but then again, I love cheese.  Pizza came out warm.  Not hot.  The dough/crust was more of a thick cracker consistency, missing that crunchy base and doughy top you get from the standard pizza.  Sauce was well flavoured, cheese stringy and toppings fresh.  We opted for pepperoni, bacon and mushroom.  They weren't stingy with their toppings either which was nice.  Great balance between cheese, sauce and toppings."
1019,Giordano's,I must admit Chicago pizza is better than NY pizza. I had a wonderful experience at Giordano's. The service was good and the food was as well. Luckily I went at the right time because as soon as I sat at the bar a crowd of people came in. Each Giordano's had a pretty decent wait time and was always packed. I order the deep dish Chicago pizza and I was full off of none slice but it was so good I ate two. It was flavorful and the crust of the pizza was soft. The waiter was good being that he was very busy he made sure he welcomed everyone.
1020,Giordano's,"The cheesecurds here are amazing!! The deep dish pizza, which is what I came to experience, was quite tasty as well! It was almost like an upside down pizza (crust still on the bottom) baked in a cheesecake pan. I loved it, and as the self proclaimed foodie I am (üíÅüèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è), I would absolutely recommend coming here üëåüëåüëå"
1021,Giordano's,"Excellent deep dish pizza!  Known for their ‚Äúcheese-pull‚Äù and there is a LOT of cheese on this pizza.  Want to go back just for this pizza. Cool restaurant and their headquarters located in same building. Can host private parties and there is a bar area, separate from dining room. Reasonably priced as well!"
1022,Giordano's,"We got here at just the right time before the lunch rush began. We were seated right away and our sever was amazing. She was super funn and really helpful. She recommended we get a small size instead of the individual, as we get more for a better deal. The pizza was delicious!"
1023,Giordano's,pizza and the setting at this location is excellent. one of the best spots of its kind in the area. this place has a great feel to it. menu is similar to a restaurant in jacksonville i liked.
1024,Giordano's,"Delish! Good service and the deep dish pizza was yummy! We had the Chicago Classic with mushrooms, pepperoni, green peppers and onions. Deep dish takes 40-45 min. But grab a drink or an appetizer and be prepared to be happily full."
1025,Giordano's,"Best experience ever. The service was exceptional, very friendly."
1026,Giordano's,"Giordano‚Äôs is a tradition do us every time we come to Chicago. We have tried multiple different pizza joints in Chicago thinking we may find a better pie but it never happens. Be aware wait times are up there, surely you couldn‚Äôt expect the best deep dish pizza and no wait time? Lol! Also be aware you will never be able to eat all this damn pizza wow! We keep coming back!"
1027,Giordano's,Deep dish pizza tons of oozing cheese! But takes 40 min... so some drinks and appetizers to wait.. but worth the wait
1028,Giordano's,"Great place to eat deep dish pizza, it will simply put a big smile on your face once you take the first bite üòç."
1029,Giordano's,"The price and wait were a bit on the high side (hour wait after ordering the pizza and 23 for small veggie deep dish) but it was totally worth it! The pizza was amazing! Loved every bite and the small was more than big enough for 2 adults. I am picky when it comes to pizza, but this place rocked. Our waitress was very nice too."
1030,Giordano's,"When you want DEEP Dish pizza in Chicago, then is only ONE place to go, Giordano's for the win!"
1031,Giordano's,"I like it here, excellent food & service. Definitely worth a return visit"
1032,Giordano's,Best pizza I love to get some when I‚Äôm in town
1033,Giordano's,Was visiting Chicago for the weekend and this place came highly recommended. Did not disappoint! If you‚Äôre in Chicago and looking for your deep dish experience definitely go here
1034,Giordano's,"Went in around 4p.m. looking for something good to eat, and was not disappointed with the food here.  The pizza here lives up to the hype it generates.  The pizza is made with fresh, quality ingredients, which adds to the great taste of the pizza here.  Didn't get anything from the menu, but did order a customized puzza, which was great.  Had to wait about twenty minutes for the pizza to come out, but it was worth the wait.  The service was lacking though.  Had to keep asking the waiter for drinks.  Restaurant was pretty clean. Other than that, everything was great.  Will definitely go back for more.  The atmosphere was very laid back, and relaxing.  Great place to go to for a great meal."
1035,Giordano's,"Best server I have seen in years! Friendly, attentive and had a great personality. Food was great also!"
1036,Giordano's,"We enjoyed the deep dish pizza, it is delicious. The lady who served us is a very nice person, her name is Biki. We are going to go again. Yemm"
1037,Giordano's,The best place where you can find a cheaper deep dish pizza and the attention there are the best. The restaurant looks very nice and the food it's delicious. Very good job.
1038,Giordano's,"When you go to Chicago, you should really be having some pizza. My husband and I went here around 10pm on a Friday night and were seated right away."
1039,Giordano's,The restaurant is open later on the weekends so that is a plus.
1040,Giordano's,"Food: My husband and I each got our own personal pizza. I got a mushroom deep dish with their buttercrust. The pizza was amazing. I am not usually one for deep dish pizza, but this may have converted me. The crust was rolled out thinly (not to be confused with thin crust pizza) and filled with lots of cheese and topped with their delicious tomato sauce."
1041,Giordano's,"My husband got Giordano's Chicago Classic. He is not a fan of pizza in general, but he enjoyed his pizza. He says he likes it better than regular pizza because the cheese is on the bottom."
1042,Giordano's,"We also got the combination platter to share. This platter was really made for definitely more than 2 people, but everything was delicious. My favorite part of the platter were the cheddar cubes."
1043,Giordano's,"Service: The service at Giordano's was pretty standard. Our server was kind and attentive. She made the suggestion of ordering an appetizer as those come out quickly while the pizzas take longer as they're made when you order them. Our appetizer came out quickly, and our pizzas followed around when we were about done eating it."
1044,Giordano's,"There‚Äôs a reason this place is regarded as one of the best places to have deep dish pizza. We went here on Saturday afternoon and luckily didn‚Äôt have to wait long to get the table. The sampler plate, customized deep dish pizza and tiramisu were awesome and mind blowing. The staff was friendly and quantity, quality of the food is great and the price is very reasonable. Would love to visit again when in Chicago."
1045,Giordano's,"Deep dish pizza is a must in Chicago and there's no better place than Giordano's. We got the veggie deep dish, it was delicous and filling all the way down to the crust!"
1046,Giordano's,pretty good Chicago style pizza. server was great but the people upfront could be more attentive. my daughter loved the pizza
1047,Giordano's,"The absolute best pizza in Chicago. Budget some time when you visit because it took longer than we expected to cook, but it was amazing and absolutely worth it. We shared a deep dish and as delicious as it was, it was so filling we had plenty to take home. A must if you‚Äôre in Chicago!!!"
1048,Giordano's,"Great pizza and very tasty. One of the best places to have pizza in Chicago! Authentic deep dish pizza. Just 1 draw back, because it‚Äôs all fresh and made to specific order, the wait time can be a bit long. However, it is worth it."
1049,Giordano's,"Possibly the best pizza I‚Äôve ever had in my life! Very cheesy, very fresh! Appetizers were also delicious!"
1050,Giordano's,One of my fav places for Pizza. the place has an awesome feel to it. i see why this place has a lot of positive reviews.
1051,Giordano's,"Fast service, and a great texting system to let you know when you're table is ready. Our server's technique and sense of humor helped to authenticate our Chicago Deep Dish experience! The food here is too good to pass up when you're visiting the city! Very comfortable dining experience."
1052,Giordano's,We were in Chicago just for a night. Friends advised us about this place. Well that deep dish pizza is not a pizza actually but more kind of a pie. Though they have a classic version too. The place is extremely crowded and noisy - not a place for a romantic dinner :)) Be ready for the queues to be seated. The food was delicious. We had starter (calamari) and deep dish Giordano‚Äôs style. Calamari were surprisingly good for a pizza place. But after we could have just 2 slices of pizza and took away the rest - everybody does the same! The pizza was nice even next day without heating. Their sauce is really delicious. Experience the place and deep dish pizza if you‚Äôre in a city üëçüèº but not for every time pizza fest imho Pizzas are better as they are üçïüçïüçï
1053,Giordano's,"Amazing pizza with just right amount of crust + mozzarella + tomato sauce in perfect ratio. At 460 calories per slice it's not something you should eat every day, but it certainly doesn't taste so heavy or 'too much'. They also have gluten free option for the health conscious but was recommended against it if you want the real deal. I can see why, just get the regular one and don't eat the crust."
1054,Giordano's,Everything very nice. Like the environment in both floors. The waiter very cool and friendly. And the food perfect like always.
1055,Giordano's,"Great environment (and service!) and, most importantly, DELICIOUS pizza! For lunch, my boyfriend and I shared the boneless chicken bites appetizer and a small deep dish pizza, which was more than enough food for the two of us (with plenty of leftovers, which made for a quick, yummy breakfast in the hotel the next morning before we headed out of town). At noon on a Thursday, there was no wait (or big crowds), which made our experience even better. This is a MUST for anyone visiting the city - don't miss out!"
1056,Giordano's,All I have to say is deep dish was the best bur make sure you have an empty belly because just one made me full and my family bought two and we were about to burst open.
1057,Giordano's,"Didn't expect much of Chicago pizza but boy was I wrong. Cool place, efficient and friendly staff and good food."
1058,Giordano's,"Awesome experience! Was very satisfied with the service, food, and the atmosphere was everyone friendly! I'll gladly be back!"
1059,Giordano's,"Great touristy spot right in the middle of Chicago. Always expect a long wait here unless you want to sit by the bar. We were able to pre order our pizza even when we were able to wait for our table. We ordered the meat lovers and classic deep dish pizza. Key about the pizza here is to have it with extra basil leaves, spicy pepper flakes, cheese or ranch on the side. Adds some extra flavor and elevates the pizza. The amount of sauce to cheese ratio was perfect. The crust was extra thick and baked to provide some awesome flavor. 2 large pies between 4 people was plenty for us."
1060,Giordano's,Love their food here. Excellent clean environment extremely nice place to eat.
1061,Giordano's,"Ordered the personal deep dish pizza for one in the set lunch menu. There are 3 choices cheese, pepperonis or sausages. You can make it your own too but it will be an hour wait. I thought the deep dish pizza is going to be very very heavy because it is thick and there are lot of cheese, the amazing tomato sauce make give it the perfect balance. There will always be a wait at Giordano's and is definitely worth it."
1062,Giordano's,Great location and lunch specials. I was happy to receive fresh and tasty food quickly.  The service was friendly. It was open and airy. Upstairs there was additional seating and clean restrooms.
1063,Giordano's,"This top 3 Chicago deep dish pizza joint is becoming more and more ubiquitous and commercialized, but remains consistent in its quality. Yes, it takes 45 minutes. Get over it."
1064,Giordano's,"Pizza was delicious...I would have gave it 5 stars but its about 45 minutes. Would suggest if dinning with 2 people get a small we got a medium between 2 people and it was alot, good but alot."
1065,Giordano's,"What is there to say? If you‚Äôre crazy about pizza this is a must do in Chicago. Authentic Deep Dish Pizza. We didn‚Äôt dine in, we got take our both times and had a blast eating it at home. I eat a lot but 2 slices of this will ruin me. The pizza is full of taste through every bite. Love. It."
1066,Giordano's,"Nice service and great food. Amazing deep dish pizza, a must try in Chicago! We had the deep dish pizza with sausage, garlic fries and cesar salad. I totally recommend it"
1067,The Cheesecake Factory,It's a lovely place with outdoor seating.
1068,The Cheesecake Factory,"This is a 4 star, kid-friendly, vegetarian-friendly place that serves American food and desserts which also serves alcohol."
1069,The Cheesecake Factory,"It was my first time in this restaurant chain. The staff was friendly and diligent (5 stars to them), I asked to be sit on the bar and they found rapidly an space for me. About the restaurant atmosphere, well, I have to say that I'm not a fan of egyptian columns and Victorian style. I just wanted to try their famous cheesecake, after all, its where its name came from. I tried the Chocolate Mousse Cheesecake and a cappuccino. The cheesecake was... decent, actually I was a little disappointed, maybe I should have tried the Original first. The coffee was good. Whatever, I keep intact my hope that the next time will be better."
1070,The Cheesecake Factory,"Cheesecake Factory is one of the few chain Restaurants that have held standards,  quality of food, drink and service. The food is delicious and always great portions so whether you are a  local or tourist is a nice end after visiting the top of the John Hancock Building. Hard to save room for dessert but an absolute must and certainly something for everyone. Great Service and it's nice to not feel rushed,  just sit back and enjoy."
1071,The Cheesecake Factory,Love Cheesecake Factory! Great food and cocktails! Never a bad experience. Customer service was great as always and staff were super cautious on capacity seating and safety protocols during this pandemic. We felt safe and glad to eat out on our weekend trip to Chicago!
1072,The Cheesecake Factory,Food was great! A little pricey but you forget about that once you have some cheesecake.
1073,The Cheesecake Factory,The person over the phone was rude but we still went last minute on Friday night. We were welcomed nicely by the girls at the front and was seated right away although the guy over the phone told us we may not get table since the kitchen is closing. Our waiter was extremely nice and very accommodating. However the food taste didn't meet our expectation. I wish the food tasted good. We had food from Cheese cake factory before and it was delicious but somehow Chicago taste was blah.
1074,The Cheesecake Factory,"Despite a dessert being forgotten about per my delivery, it was redelivered and (along with my other food) was absolutely delicious! The managers went above and beyond to make sure that I was satisfied with my order! As a matter of fact, I literally just placed another order a few minutes ago! The salmon is amazing!"
1075,The Cheesecake Factory,"Really nice, banana pudding must try. Order online you make quick pickup. For delivery usually delivery drivers avoid this place because of parking it has small orders and small tips. Parking is little hard but it's worth your visit."
1076,The Cheesecake Factory,Love Cheesecake Factory! Great food and cocktails! Never a bad experience. Customer service was great as always and staff were super cautious on capacity seating and safety protocols during this pandemic. We felt safe and glad to eat out on our weekend trip to Chicago!

1079,The Cheesecake Factory,Great place to eat under the John Hancock Tower. The foods are delicious and with the calories on the menu you can eat whatever match to your diet. Great and quick service.
1080,The Cheesecake Factory,"I can't eat in person but my take out was almost on the spot, for my dessert I ordered a sundae and got cake instead. The food was delicious and tasted great with my wine but they lose a star because they doubled checked my order with me and when I checked the bag to separate the desserts I realized one was wrong. It took too long to fix and I ended up missing my ride and waiting 10 minutes in the cold for a new one."
1081,The Cheesecake Factory,We really enjoyed the food. Food is definitely worth the money!
1082,The Cheesecake Factory,"I love the consistency of coming to Cheesecake Factory. It's a nice atmosphere, the drinks are good, I love the menu. They choose great staff and I always have a straight-up good time."
1083,The Cheesecake Factory,Always a good place to take tourists/friends visiting from out of town
1084,The Cheesecake Factory,"We have been to many cheesecake factories and this is our all time favorite one! Our favorite is the orange chicken, crab cake bites, and lettuce wraps! The inside is one giant mushroom! Such a cool atmosphere!"
1085,The Cheesecake Factory,"Food was delicious food was delicious, portions were just right oh my goodness that we walk out of their stuff! The tropical drink that I had with the ginger in it was amazing would definitely come back for that and the Tex-Mex egg rolls"
1086,The Cheesecake Factory,One of my favorite restaurants in the town! The amenience and the service is very good and really liked the food. There are good number of variety for vegetarians too. And the best part is if you let them know about the birthday in your group the waiters come to your table to sing and wish you a Happy Birthday with a complimentary cheesecake! üòÑ
1087,The Cheesecake Factory,"Really like this place Interesting interior design, you'll either love it or hate it but it has low lighting which preserves intimacy. Very wide range of food choices. Outdoor seating available. As expected from the name, an extensive cheesecake list. Unfortunately, they have changed my old favourite ""oreo cheesecake"" which is just not the same :-( wouldn't choose that again. It's still a nice restaurant with good food and helpful staff. Would go again."
1088,The Cheesecake Factory,You can never go wrong with cheesecake factory. Due to Covid there were number of tables which were closed. There was a one hour wait. But it was still worth it.
1089,The Cheesecake Factory,Pasta and sauce really exceed my expectations for the Price! Really worth to try. Was looking and tasting so good that I forgot to take a picture before starting to eat
1090,The Cheesecake Factory,I like the Cheesecake Factory for a variety of reasons for instance there are a variety of choices and flavors my whole family likes the delicious restaurant. It is very clean and the staff Are very helpful and cheerful!
1091,The Cheesecake Factory,"The atmosphere is enchanting. All the wait staff are friendly, the host especially; He was always smiling. Avocado rolls with cilantro sauce were great. I couldn't finish the lemon raspberry cheesecake. It was sooooo sweet."
1092,The Cheesecake Factory,"Oh my God! If you want good food in quantity come absolutely to the cheesecake factory! The hardest thing is to choose from the long list of dishes and desserts! My favorite: lemon-raspberry cheesecake. If you're a tourist, I think it's a good place to stop before or after seeing the view from the top of the Hancock tower!"
1093,The Cheesecake Factory,"Delicious meal! Amazing service provided by Jostin. Jostin made the meal a great experience, by being extremely personable and engaging! Would highly recommend."
1094,The Cheesecake Factory,They have great food in regular times when they are open. And I love the interior design. But now it is the best place to get carry out cheesecake!
1095,The Cheesecake Factory,The service was great. We had the chicken taquitos which were amazing. Very flavorful but not spicy.
1096,The Cheesecake Factory,Stopped in to get cheesecake to go. They have the best cheesecake and flavors I've ever tasted.
1097,The Cheesecake Factory,fantastic cheesecake. staff was great as well
1098,The Cheesecake Factory,"I've never seen a place look so fresh but also so douchy lol. But not in a bad way. The vibe is clean af. Good looking restaurant overall. Oh, and the food is pretty good."
1099,The Cheesecake Factory,From the minute we arrived they were very nice. We were only 2 so it was only a 5-7 minute wait. When we were seated the waitress Ashley greeted us right away. When she came back for our orders we asked for recommendations and we ended up ordering  one of the items recommended. We ordered the bacon bacon burger with fries and the southwest chicken sandwich and one raspberry lemonade and a cucumber mint lemonade.  I wouldn't normally order the cucumber drink but it was fabulous. The sandwich and burger were also fabulous. The sandwich was huge and I had to stop eating the bread of it I was stuffed.  We also ordered one piece of the Adam's peanut butter cup cheesecake to share. It was amazing.  The only negative is the washrooms. They were horrific and needed a cleaning there was water and garbage everywhere. Otherwise I'd go back in a heartbeat.
1100,The Cheesecake Factory,"Awesome place beautiful cheesecakes and wonderful mains and starters and deserts   Looking forward to have Cheesecake Factory in Philippines. The ambiance, foods and hosts are  excellent! üíñ"
1101,The Cheesecake Factory,Very busy location and the cheesecakes are a bit pricey but the portion size makes up for it. The staff were very nice as I waited for my cheesecake (takeout). Large waiting area. Very clean inside with funky decor.
1102,The Cheesecake Factory,Cheesecake itself was amazing. Super thick and creamy and delectable.
1103,The Cheesecake Factory,I love going here and getting take out or just a delicious slice of cheese cake.
1104,The Cheesecake Factory,Best Cheesecake hands-down. Great service and experience every time.
1105,The Cheesecake Factory,"My favourite location! It is a little harder to navigate with small kids, but nonetheless, as always wonderful staff, and great vibes."
1106,The Cheesecake Factory,Great food and service. Breakfast was amazing! The environment is fun with interesting door handles.
1107,The Cheesecake Factory,"I just love this place, especially the Jambalaya chicken shrimp pasta"
1108,The Cheesecake Factory,"Today was National Cheesecake Day and so it was very busy.  We waited an hour for our food, the two of us, but our waiter Jeffery was very nice and fun. He got us more bread and made the whole experience enjoyable even though he was serving 4 other tables. One of the managers came out to greet us and apologize for the wait. When our food came though, it was really good! Worth the wait and let's not forget the cheesecake! Despite how crazy it was everyone was friendly and approachable. Great way to spend the evening!"
1109,The Cheesecake Factory,"Never a disappointment.  This place has it all.  Picky eaters stay home, this place if for real people."
1110,The Cheesecake Factory,Nice place for eating not only Cheesecakes but  also other delicious dishes. Value for money acceptable. Sometimes the wait can be long though
1111,The Cheesecake Factory,Piece of cheesecake to go. Fattening but excellent as usual.
1112,The Cheesecake Factory,Yulitza was a great costumer service agent. Rarely I get such a good service. From the cake to the drink my wife and I thought the value of every cent.
1113,The Cheesecake Factory,"Oh! Cheesecake Factory is our favorite everywhere in the USA- South, North, Midwest!! Specialties are favorites here. Our first choice has been the Thai Chili Chicken, White Chili Chicken... and the list goes on! Big, cozy, family friendly! Reasonably crowded on special occasion and busy time of the year!"
1114,The Cheesecake Factory,Love the atmosphere and the food was amazing. Good service
1115,The Cheesecake Factory,"Delicious food, reasonable prices...very interesting decore at the location here in the John Hancock Bldg‚Ä¶"
1116,The Cheesecake Factory,A very busy place so expected slow service.
1117,The Cheesecake Factory,"But menu is just beautiful and food is great too. There vanilla milkshake is just the best. I would recommend going light on the main dishes or just get a small plate so that you can enjoy the real thing, the cheesecakes!! This specific location is quite nice, located inside the John hancock centre beautiful patio."
1118,The Cheesecake Factory,"So, true story: I've been trying to eat in a cheesecake factory for ever! Every time I travel to the US I never can because the lines are HUGE and I have a lot to do."
1119,The Cheesecake Factory,"Well, on this occasion I reserved a night just to wait and get there and BOY am I grateful for it."
1120,The Cheesecake Factory,"Now, to get the worst thing out of the way: I HATE cheesecake. I legit went because of the hype and because of how delicious the menu was besides cheesecake. It was worth every second and every penny."
1121,The Cheesecake Factory,"Great place for dinner. The one thing I specifically like about this place is the sheer amount of options they have. The place can get very crowded sometimes especially during weekends. I went few times on a weekend and had to wait for over 30 minutes. The Lasagna is just amazing and is the food I order the most. The ambiance is pretty cool if you are going for a nice evening. Overall, had a great experience."
1122,The Cheesecake Factory,Customer service was great steak was slightly charred to my liking but took it off bill no problem and remade!
1123,The Cheesecake Factory,Service was a little slow. It was in the late morning so the restaurant wasn't very busy. The cheesecake and hot chocolate were awesome.
1124,The Cheesecake Factory,Good food...Good atmosphere!
1125,The Cheesecake Factory,Affordable and tasty food. Good menu with many things to try.
1126,The Cheesecake Factory,Raspberry lemon & Cinnabon cheesecake both delish
1127,The Cheesecake Factory,My friend and I were here for a workshop and HAD to make a stop at the Cheesecake Factory and it was of course delicious. I ordered the chicken pot pie (see below). We left stuffed and satisfiedüòä
1128,The Cheesecake Factory,"The place is a lil old in my opinion, but overall experience is pleasant."
1129,The Cheesecake Factory,"Our waitress was absolutely amazing, I was fasting that night that I went out due to ramadan this year and she was entirely understanding of our situation. She brought out the food and drinks and the perfect time and after about 20 hours of not eating, nothing in the world tasted better than this. Price is to be expected for a night out in downtown Chicago. The view right below the john hancock, was great as expected. Definitely will return. The cheesecake as picture was fantastic as expected, however her carrot cake was just as equally good."
1130,The Cheesecake Factory,"The Cheesecake Factory has been one of my favorite restaurants for years now. Their consistency is what really draws me in and if anyone asks me what I get there, it has been the fabulous steak Diane. I‚Äôve gotten it for years and will continue to do so! A few friends and I arrived at this location after having walked there during a heavy downpour and the seating hostess and waiters were all so friendly and kind about it. We felt bad for getting the seats wet and were offered extra napkins and even a few towels! The place is always jam packed but it never slows down the service."
1131,The Cheesecake Factory,Even while social distancing they were serving great food and great service
1132,The Cheesecake Factory,"Astonishing architecture inside. Good food, nice service. Prepare to wait for your table for 10 - 30 minutes."
1133,The Cheesecake Factory,"My experience at the Cheesecake Factory was a great one. I had some pasta,a steak, salmon, asparagus, broccoli, mashed potatoes, and tuxedo, red velvet, turtle, banana cheesecake. All of the food was good and cooked exactly as I wanted. The different cheesecakes were all very tasty as well. My host Destiny and my server Justin were both excellent. 10/10 would recommend."
1134,The Cheesecake Factory,"This place is bomb .com ! Drinks are expensive, but the food is outstanding! Oh and the cheesecake selection, insane!"
1135,The Cheesecake Factory,Food was so good. I'm doing low carb and I was still able to have a delicious piece of cheesecake
1136,The Cheesecake Factory,"Tables near windows are cold and you may feel uncomfortable sitting in there especially in winter time. I liked an atmosphere, interior, cheesecakes :) . Service is good enough. They serve fast which is very good. Background musics are just amazing. I enjoyed my evening (dinner) in this place. Really cozy place . I think, at the  weekend this place will be crowded and too noisy. The interior is so unusual and beautiful."
1137,The Cheesecake Factory,Large portions and very family friendly
1138,The Cheesecake Factory,"My family and I went here today for my daughters 18th birthday and everything was perfect! Our great experience started with our hostess (forgot to ask her name). We told her it was my daughters birthday and my wife asked her for a comfortable place to sit, she said it might take an extra few minutes and we were fine with that. It was the lunch rush but I think we were seated at the greatest spot in the restaurant. It was by the window with a great view. Thank you again it made everybody so happy. As if that wasn't enough....Our waiter Jake, as busy as he was, made us feel like we were his only customers. He couldn't have been more polite and friendly. Jake gathered some of his fellow wait staff and they sang happy birthday to my daughter. They sounded like a professional chorus. Thank you Jake and crew! The food was all great and of course the cheesecake was delicious. I want to mention that this was my first time here and this is absolutely a real review. Thank you all involved for a special lunch."
1139,The Cheesecake Factory,"Usually busy on weekends, wait time was worth, excellent staff, nice ambience and mouth watering dessertsüç∞ We ordered Stuffed mushroom in appetizer it was perfectly done with Fontina and Parmesan Cheese, Garlic and Herbs in a Wine Sauce. And we ordered Evelyns Favorite Pasta which was loaded with veggies which was perfect with our red wine üç∑and while you wait on for your order they serve bread with oil."
1140,The Cheesecake Factory,"Not sure if they take reservations, but we were a walk in group of 5 at dinnertime during the holidays. Had a wait but it was less than an hour. Plenty of comfortable seating while waiting or there's a bar. Atmosphere and decor were spot on. Setting was loud in that hip and busy hot spot way; you had to speak loudly to be heard across your table, but you didn't have to yell.  Food was amazing, service was great. We all felt it was a wonderful time."
1141,The Cheesecake Factory,Food was great! A little pricey but you forget about that once you have some cheesecake.
1142,The Cheesecake Factory,"Delicious food and fantastic service. Cheesecake Factory is a great place to eat with your family and friends. It lacks the one on one environment you would want for a romantic night out but do not let that stop you from giving it a shot. It's a great stop in the city and it is along the bustling magnificent mile. If you are driving, do not worry, they validate parking up to $25. That's more than half of the parking price if you stayed along the strip for few hours."
1143,The Cheesecake Factory,Neat restaurant and great cheesecake but its a bit juvenile in its decor for what could be an upscale restaurant. We will deffinately be coming back though because the food is good and we had fun.
1144,The Cheesecake Factory,I've really enjoyed myself my niece took me to brunch after church and she had the gumbo and I had the chicken and waffles very nice on the time food presentation and the syrup for the waffles I am in love with will be back soon
1145,The Cheesecake Factory,We were visiting from Canada and LOVED this restaurant! The waiters were all great (we were there 4 evenings in a row) and the food is exceptional. I highly recommend the Parmesan Herb Crusted Chicken and the Adam's Peanut Butter Cheesecake üôÇ
1146,The Cheesecake Factory,"My experience was AWESOME!! I was celebrating my 81st birthday and management paid for my three course meal! How awesome is that? I really really felt special. The food was excellent, I had the salmon and it was cooked perfectly.  Thanks management of Cheesecake Factory, I will be back."
1147,The Cheesecake Factory,"Yummy, nice looking place, yummy food, clean. High prices, desserts VERY sweet. Great to go wen ur not on a diet   Friday evening dinner was lovely, with no wait for a table. Waitress was attentive while kitchen was slower than I remember. Food is delicious and dessert is a bonus!"
1148,The Cheesecake Factory,It was my friends birthday and everything was great
1149,The Cheesecake Factory,"Fast service, social distancing norms maintained!"
1150,The Cheesecake Factory,Are you starving to have a yummy desert ? CHEESE cake factory has lot of variety of cakes. Today I tried Chocolate tower. It was yummy! I would highly recommend this place!!
1151,The Cheesecake Factory,Good service from the staff and gave us his recommendation. great food
1152,The Cheesecake Factory,"This place is great. I love their bread and their extensive menu. The service is also one of the best. I have been to the Orland Park location and the Michigan Avenue location as well on the weekend and the wait was not very long. It was half an hour to 45 min around 7pm which isn't bad to me. I definitely recommend. I'll usually have the bang bang chicken and shrimp or the chicken marsala. The last time I went, my friend asked for fish tacos and my niece had buffalo wings and they were all delicious. I asked for the Tuxedo cheesecake to go because we were too full."
1153,The Cheesecake Factory,Loved this place! The staff was great.The portion size was huge & the food was really delicious.
1154,The Cheesecake Factory,Omg the waiters were fantastic! I went for my birthday and everything was perfect! I haven't been in years but it was still the same. Their new birthday cheesecake was delicious!
1155,The Cheesecake Factory,Great people great service great food and mouth watering cheesecake
1156,The Cheesecake Factory,"Such a popular place, be ready for some wait time in weekends. Had the burger and the shrimp pasta, both good value. Coffee was a bit bland though."
1157,The Cheesecake Factory,"Sadly it started off not great. They were out of so many items. My number one choice of appetizer and reason for going- but not available. Sweet Corn cake tamales. üò¢ The buffalo chicken bites appetizer is amazing though!! So much flavor. It was followed by their spinach and cheese dip. That was also a disappointment but likely because it followed that tasty prior appetizer. I got the filet mignon that was cooked perfectly and such a good flavor. The green beans and mashed potatoes were eh. Lastly, the Chocolate Tower cake is heaven!!!! Got it to go and waited to eat it later. üòã"
1158,The Cheesecake Factory,"Got our seats quickly, service was great and food was excellent."
1159,The Cheesecake Factory,"Friendly service and huge quantities. I love their Gift cards combined with the free cake eSlice. We went for lunch, although always busy. We managed to get a table within few minutes. Love their food. There‚Äôs always something for everyone"
1160,The Cheesecake Factory,Wonderful food. Great atmosphere
1161,The Cheesecake Factory,"Amazing service, amazing people :)"
1162,The Cheesecake Factory,Pretty good food and fast service for a full house. I thought the lighting was a bit dim but I guess this is the atmosphere this restaurant is trying to create. The cheesecake recommendation from our server was excellent and the raspberry sauce on the side was awesome! üòé
1163,The Cheesecake Factory,"One of my favorite places in Chicago, the food is top. If you like hamburguer try the Smoke BBQ!!  Oreo and red velvet are the best cheesecakes, but I tried many and all are good!"
1164,The Cheesecake Factory,Great food. Good service.  Out of 1 menu item and had to change well into our visit.  Our server also handed off our table to another server.  Food was good.  Pricing was as expected.
1165,The Cheesecake Factory,"When we go up to Chicago, the spouse likes to have lunch at the Cheesecake Factory. Believe it or not, we ordered the same sandwich as last time.......grilled chicken with avocado and bacon.......soooo yummy. We do swap out the french fries for the sweet potato fries. For dessert we did try a cheesecake that we hadn't tried before, Reese's peanut butter chocolate cake cheesecake. It was also very good.....not my favorite, but still very good."
1166,The Cheesecake Factory,Great food and very beautiful structure.
1167,The Cheesecake Factory,"The food in this place is delicious üòã and the lemon pie is my favorite. Is a great place to go, the structure of the restaurant is nice"
1168,The Cheesecake Factory,"Excellent! Their menu is huge with lots of healthy salad options...so you can have those ""not so healthy"" cheesecakes for dessert!"
1169,The Cheesecake Factory,"Love the food, also they have gluten free  menu. Service is a very good. Atmosphere is relaxing."
1170,The Cheesecake Factory,"Architectural design and details are fabulous, food is really good too."
1171,The Cheesecake Factory,"While on holiday from Scotland, we found a welcome respite from the Chicago rain in the Cheesecake Factory! Our server, Luke, was wonderful - not only was he very friendly and helpful, but he was brilliantly efficient.  He really made our visit special. The food was delicious and so satisfying - I particularly enjoyed the Korean Fried Cauliflower. If we're ever back in the city, I'll be sure to visit again!"
1172,M Burger,Their outdoor seating is informal and good for young folks.
1173,M Burger,"This is an affordable, kid-friendly place specialized in burgers and American food."
1174,M Burger,"Today is October 2nd 2020 at 4:20pm  I asked the
female cashier, could I have a chair that's stacked up in the inside for one of the outside tables.  Cashier tells me that the outside eating area is closed, but yet I see customer sitting at other tables eating  and the mall doesn't close until 7pm.  Poor customer service and looks at me sideways batting her eyelashes. ü¶á It's plenty of restaurants around the Water Tower Place that will gladly take my money, with a smile and good customer service"
1175,M Burger,M Burger All still holds up! That heavy metal vibes makes for a awesome visit. All the staff are great. I had the Samoa Joe burger medium rare... highly recommend it! They show old school wrestling which is just another reason to love this place. \m/
1176,M Burger,My preferred location for delicious Burgers. This location is one of my favorites. The bill was appropriate for the quality.
1177,M Burger,Great burgers and great service !!! Totally recommend.  Very laxed and cool place for good food and great company.
1178,M Burger,First cashier has her mask under her mouth she was eating at the register using the cell second fries were cold and saggy the only good at this place  dinning is clean this happened during lunch 9/22
1179,M Burger,"Great cheese burger, and cheese fries were amazing. Service was quick and friendly. Reasonable prices. Will definitely visit again."
1180,M Burger,I shared a double with cheese.and grilled onions. Tasty. A little more dine than I prefer.
1181,M Burger,M Burger All still holds up! That heavy metal vibes makes for a awesome visit. All the staff are great. I had the Samoa Joe burger medium rare... highly recommend it! They show old school wrestling which is just another reason to love this place. m/
1182,M Burger,My preferred location for delicious Burgers. This location is one of my favorites. The bill was appropriate for the quality.
1183,M Burger,Great burgers and great service !!! Totally recommend.  Very laxed and cool place for good food and great company.
1184,M Burger,"We only stopped for milkshakes, but they were well worth it!"
1185,M Burger,IMPOSSIBLE BURGER! 10/10 would recommend trying! Very flavorful and filling! First impossible I've had and I can guarantee that I'll be having more.
1186,M Burger,"Honestly, I wouldn't have gone back to M Burger for a cheeseburger after having a very mediocre one a while ago, but someone gave me a coupon, so I decided to give it another try. The burgers have definitely improved, and so have the chocolate shakes. I don't know when they improved the quality, but they seem to have done so. When I went there a while ago, everything tasted cheap, but that's no longer the case. I will try another location as well to see if the quality is consistent."
1187,M Burger,Turkey burger was excellent.
1188,M Burger,The double cheeseburger and fries were bomb yo'! They had a little wait but overall the workers were on it and doing their best to be prompt and courteous to me as well as the other waiting customers. Would recommend others trying this location if they're at the Water Tower.
1189,M Burger,This restaurant gives excellent service as well as tasty food. One of the best restaurant in the city. The food and drinks served rapidly and the rates were fair. Highly recommended.
1190,M Burger,Great tasting American food.  Pumpkin pie Shake was delicious!
1191,M Burger,"The food is always fresh and flavorful, cashiers provides excellent service. I like the cleanliness and ambience. Will come visit again."
1192,M Burger,"So to keep it short, these burgers are tasty but the fries really stole the show for me. I went with a group of 5 and we each ordered different burgers and 3 orders of fries. We loved our experience and the food but for some reason we left with the impression that the burgers didn't live up to the hype on Yelp."
1193,M Burger,The Burger and fries are delicious they remind me of steak and shake but still that's not a bad thing I would highly recommend this place. B Plus you can get something from food life as well since it's all part of the same area
1194,M Burger,"Delicious burgers. Good service. Got the farm egg bacon burger which was great. Good price on the burgers, sodas are a bit too much."
1195,M Burger,"MBurger hits the right notes with its menu, and the staff is both efficient and accurate. The goal mouth burger is my favorite,  but the other choices are worth trying. It is a popular local chain that warrants attention."
1196,M Burger,Ok place. Ok food.
1197,M Burger,Happy Birthday to MBurger today!  We stopped by for delicious burgers and fries and the place was packed!  However the line moved quickly and the employees were friendly. It was a nice surprise when the burger was free for their birthday promotion .I have been here before and will be back again .
1198,M Burger,"I really enjoyed my M burger ""impossible burger"" totally delicious!!!"
1199,M Burger,"M burger in water tower place is a tale of two burgers. What you see on the board and what gets served to you wrapped up in a bag are very different products visually. Taste wise however you're in for a treat, flavors and textures are better than you'd expect from a fast food joint like this. I'd recommend the Cooper burger if it's still available."
1200,M Burger,"Cheeseburgers were good, fries were wimpy."
1201,M Burger,I'm a Burger fan and I love this place. The bun melts in your mouth and blends perfectly with the meat patty and any extras.  I go out of my way to find an M burger.
1202,M Burger,Awesome day in chicago ended off with a delicious bacon and egg burger. So messy but those are the best
1203,M Burger,The young lady with the gold hair was so helpful to me! They didn't have any tops for the icecream so she wrapped it up in plastic for me That was so nice! Keep up the good work m burger. I'll be back :)
1204,M Burger,"Today the young lady on the register ask me did I want to try a cooper‚Äôs burgers. She explain  to me what came on it.  Tangy mayo, pickles, cooper‚Äôs cheese and fried onions. When I say it‚Äôs one of the best burgers I have ever had. Since it‚Äôs here only limit of time I am going to get this burgers as much as possible. The service was also great. Gotta love M Burger!"
1205,M Burger,VERY popular for our pre-teens who haven't ventured to test their pallets!!! Very greasy chicken but burgers were excellent!!! Not a lot of salt used!!! The beef is very good on it's own.
1206,M Burger,I ordered a black bean burger and it was so good.
1207,M Burger,Fresh tasting beef - seared amazingly. Great burger.
1208,M Burger,"Turkey burger and fries, both very tasty! They also have hot fudge dipped icecream cones!"
1209,M Burger,"Had the cheeseburger, it was good. Service was fine. First time there. Will go again to try something else."
1210,M Burger,Good food but slow service
1211,M Burger,Delicious burgers as usual and the service was super quick!
1212,M Burger,"Had my first ever M burger experience tonight. After a LONG week and a day that seemed even longer I popped into the water tower location to grab something on my walk home. After mulling over the menu and a little help from the very sweet cashier I decided on the chicken Betty. I walked the three blocks home with my bag in toe opened up the bag and realized that there was the sauce that I had requested not on the sandwich all over it. After bumming for a second I made a call to the restaurant and was asked if I would be able to make a trip back and my food would be remade, no problem. So I walked back over and was greeted pleasantly by an employee. I said my name and that I had just spoken with someone on the phone and she had my sandwich and fries made up before I could even fill up the beverage she offered me while I waited. If that weren't enough as she handed over my freshly made meal she also thanked me for calling and coming back so they could fix the situation for me and handed me a coupon and said to use it to take care of my next meal! I Immediatly went to the website and couldn't find anywhere to write about the fantastic supervisor (I believer her name was Denise?) at the water tower location. I could not let her genuine customer service and hospitality go unappreciated. I am a restaurant manager myself and I would be SO proud to have someone like her on my team!!! (On top of that my sandwich was delicious :)  )"
1213,M Burger,"Want a burger or fries? M Burger is a great choice, especially at Water Tower. Every burger is made fresh to order. Don't forget to order a shake or even a root beer float."
1214,M Burger,Good prices for a downtown burger.
1215,M Burger,"I absolutely love M burger. Great burgers and great chicken strips.   Great burger for an upscale fast food joint, but kinda expensive.  Prefer m burger to five guys.  Similar to shake shack"
1216,M Burger,I ordered cheeseburgers and their delicious fries! Never disappoints!
1217,M Burger,"Great burger for a fast food place. 4 stars only because I've had a way better, gourmet burger elsewhere for the price."
1218,M Burger,great place for a quick meal.  cheese sauce is a must.  hot fudge shake is awesome as well.
1219,M Burger,Great food at a reasonable price.  A rare find on the mag mile
1220,M Burger,Great Service and great Burgers

1223,M Burger,Great burgers and shakes

1225,M Burger,A fun place to eat give plenty of fries better than McDonald's all the food get approval
1226,M Burger,"Just had the ice cream but it was really good.   Decent fries place a little dirty, but really good burgers"
1227,M Burger,"Great impossible burger. Shakes are good, ridiculously thick."
1228,M Burger,Only because service was slow other than that everything was fine
1229,M Burger,Oh my god when I tell you this place was heaven. It was heaven. Best oreo shake I've ever had. Burger was scrumptious and so were the fries. The ice cream cone is so light and creamy but thick at the same time ughhh I beg you to please come here if you want a really good shake or burger
1230,M Burger,"The fries were horrible and the cheese was disgusting, it was runny and had absolutely no flavor. The cheeseburger was tiny, could pass for a kids meal size burger. Now let's get to the prices, each burger is $6 and the cheese fries a whopping $4 ea simply insane!   Willl never go back.."
1231,M Burger,Spicy chix sandwich is the best. Soooo meaty. Just right.
1232,M Burger,Great place to eat to grab a bite
1233,M Burger,Great food an people an shakes
1234,M Burger,I had a M burger and my daughter had the tenders. The food was delicious and the tenders are wayyyyyyyy better than before. The staff was friendly and made sure that we had everything thing that we needed despite the rude lady that was in front of us giving these people a hard time our visit was great!
1235,M Burger,Grilled cheese sandwich off menu was very good
1236,M Burger,Lover there burgers that spicy jalapeno burger was damn delicious
1237,M Burger,Wonderfully Made...Flavors were powerful.
1238,M Burger,Mall food at its finest. Pricey but better than other options.
1239,M Burger,"Good place, good burgers. Relatively quick service considering the lines."
1240,M Burger,"Great burger, but took some time to receive order."
1241,M Burger,They have the plant meat burger thing and it tastes like an actual meat. They also have good I've cream.
1242,M Burger,The Impossible Burger is the best vegetarian burger I have ever had.
1243,M Burger,"Good burgers, fries, and service."
1244,M Burger,Well they don't inform you that salt is being added to the burger as soon as it hit the grill. Some people don't eat salt Very good for the price!
1245,M Burger,Love the chicken sandwiches
1246,M Burger,"Friendly staff and the most important thing, great burgers, really delicious meat!"
1247,M Burger,Classic burgers at reasonable prices in the Watertower Place!
1248,M Burger,Best Burger in town.
1249,M Burger,Great place to get great food
1250,M Burger,burgers were sooooooooooo good that I came back   the next week.
1251,M Burger,Food is usually real good. A bit overpriced but that is to be expected in the neighborhood. Sometimes it‚Äôs a bit of a longer wait once you order your food. Seating can also be a challenge during peak times.
1252,M Burger,Really impressed. Kids loved it and I had the amazing Turkey jalape√±o burger. Great prices too.
1253,M Burger,Freshly made turkey burger was great.
1254,M Burger,"I luv, luv luv this place. I usually order the impossible Burger custom and Toiny cooks it just the way I like it-m - seasoned and well done. The staff is great Shaquita told me how to sign up for texts  to receive more savings. Cleanna is always upbeat and bubbly and takes my order perfectly every time. Tamika is always helpful too. Thank you guys for the most enjoyable dinner! Charlotte"
1255,M Burger,Love their fries n burgers

1257,M Burger,They were super fast! My chicken sandwich and fries were both hot and yummy
1258,M Burger,Great food and friendly staff!
1259,M Burger,Amazing Burgers and shakes!
1260,M Burger,"GREAT CHICAGO STYLE HOTDOGS & BURGERS, REASONABLY PRICED AND FUN ‚ÄúDOG BREED‚Äù THEMED ATMOSPHERE"
1261,M Burger,"Ever since this place opened, I have been bringing friends to eat here.  The menu is small, but all of the options are great, so it's not hard to decide.  The staff is friendly and the restaurant is always very clean.  If you don't want to wait in line during the lunchtime rush, just go to their booth in Foodlife"
1262,M Burger,They need to break out of Chicago and give Shake Shack a fight. M burger is better value and a finer burger. NYC next please!
1263,M Burger,The milkshakes are delicious!
1264,M Burger,From NYC.  Impressed with the burgers. Look forward to seeing some m burgers in NY
1265,M Burger,Love the service and the turkey burgers
1266,M Burger,One of the best decisions of my my life to eat here. The burgers are excelent. The fries are the best I have ever had. The strawberry smoothie is also to die for! I strongly recomend this fast food resturant to anyone looking for a quick bite.
1267,M Burger,Great burgers and shakes
1268,M Burger,Nice lunch spot.  Great vibe.
1269,M Burger,Very good burger and fry establishment.
1270,M Burger,The best burgers in Chicago and the malts were to die for.
1271,M Burger,Good lettuce wraps
1272,M Burger,Burgers could have been bigger
1273,M Burger,Love the ice cream
1274,M Burger,"If you prefer meat for your burger, the Bacon Double cheeseburger is a really solid choice. The cheese is melted and become with burger with refreshing vegetables. The Fries were nice because they were standard and had no unique flavor, but decent fries! Original Lemonade or other drinks tasted fresh"
1275,M Burger,"One of the best hamburgers in Chicago, very good quality and authentic flavor. I recommend you also try the chicken sandwich with buffalo and bluechese"
1276,Greek Kitchen,"This is an affordable, vegetarian-friendly place specialized in Green and Mediterranean food."
1277,Greek Kitchen,Nice spot for tasty greek food. I really loved this place. The service was very helpful and observant.
1278,Greek Kitchen,My preferred location for tasty greek food. Service treated us so nice. The place has a great feel to it. Mood here reminds me of San Diego's scene.
1279,Greek Kitchen,One of my fav places for Greek food. The food was amazing. The staff was very welcoming and sociable.
1280,Greek Kitchen,Greek food at this location - yummy. the bill was fair for the quality of food.
1281,Greek Kitchen,"Greek food, mmm, awesome. Do yourself a favor and try this place."
1282,Greek Kitchen,"greek food at this location - delicious. Visited about four, it was not full. Service is consistently above par. Prices are fair. Feels like a cafe in Phoenix that I enjoyed visiting."
1283,Greek Kitchen,"Love this place. Lamb and beef plate is great, I get that with hummus veggies and rice. So good."
1284,Greek Kitchen,"If you're going for lunch, you better get there before 12:10 because the line is usually out the door but even then, the food is worth the wait."
1285,Greek Kitchen,My fav spot for quality greek food. I love snacking here. This place has a great atmosphere. Food is like a restaurant in Jacksonville I loved.
1286,Greek Kitchen,One of my top places for delicious greek food. Food was so fresh. Had a friend come into town and asked me to take him here again. Mood here reminds me of San Diego's scene.
1287,Greek Kitchen,My favorite location for delicious greek food. Service is always super even when they have a full house. Staff treated us so nice. It has a great atmosphere. I see why this place has a lot of positive reviews.
1288,Greek Kitchen,"greek food... so tasty. Arrived at six, it was not packed. Certainly worth a return visit. The prices are fair for the quality of food."
1289,Greek Kitchen,Greek food and service here is quality. Very appetizing. The service was helpful and kind. The bill was good for what you get.
1290,Greek Kitchen,"Good stuff. You can either choose a pita, a bowl, or a salad with your choice of protein, as well as toppings. Similar to Chipotle or Roti, you can pick what you would like. I like either the pita or the bowl with the lamb (traditional gyro filling), the tomato and cucumber, onion, spicy red sauce, and tzatziki sauce. I've never tried the salads or the side dishes, but I bet they're good. It's even better that it's pretty much across the street from my work. I usually order to-go, but there is indoor seating if you prefer to dine-in (as of 10/20, although capacity is reduced due to COVID)"
1291,Greek Kitchen,Food is so good and feels like I'm eating healthy even of it's not the healthiest.
1292,Greek Kitchen,"The food is great--very filling. I love the artwork as well! The ordering process is simple as well. Just go to the front (start on the left--pay at the end, on the right) choose a plate, handheld, or salad (those are the menu choices), they'll ask you what you want on it, and just go down the line, then pay at the end. If you order online, I think you go to the right (the cash register) to pick up your order. After you have your food, choose a seat and enjoy, or take it with you to go."
1293,Greek Kitchen,lamb gyro all the way.  forget the chicken
1294,Greek Kitchen,"Delicious fast casual Greek food in a clean environment.  Pick your protein(gyro, chicken, etc.), your preparation(pita, plate, salad) and choose from a large variety of toppings, many free, a few with up charges.   Enjoyable food at reasonable prices."
1295,Greek Kitchen,Greek food and the atmosphere here is quality. normally i would have posted a pic but food looked so good i couldn't stop. service treated us so kindly. prices that won't break you.
1296,Greek Kitchen,good food very nice staff
1297,Greek Kitchen,greek food and the scene here is great. Everyone at our table was very satisfied. The service here is friendly.
1298,Greek Kitchen,Awesome awesome gyro plate!!!! The atmosphere is great and the service was great as well. Would definitely go back.
1299,Greek Kitchen,Great food at great prices. Enough seating but it does get crowded at lunch time
1300,Greek Kitchen,Most of the food items here are pretty good. My only complaint are that pita chips are so oily and over fried. Rice in the rice pudding is so hard.
1301,Greek Kitchen,"Quick, fast and easy ordering and serving. Portion size won't leave you hungry üòÅ"
1302,Greek Kitchen,My go-to place for fast Greek food! I love their hand wraps and the fact that they let you put fries in them. Fries make every sandwich and wrap taste 100x better! I had the lamb and it was pretty damn good. The chicken with Greek yogurt dip is a good pick too. Need to try falafel next time!
1303,Greek Kitchen,"I love the food best gyro, kitchen rotisserie is my best and with a spinach salad on the side yummyy :) I would really recommend to go have a delicious great dinner in this place.. Love it"
1304,Greek Kitchen,"Good food, cafeteria-style. The staff moves the line quickly but they aren't very friendly."
1305,Greek Kitchen,"GRK Kitchen is a great addition to the selection of Loop lunch spots.  I usually go with the rotisserie chicken on a Lebanese wrap.  The flavors are all very fresh and vibrant as you‚Äôd expect from Mediterranean cuisine.  If you go with the wrap, don‚Äôt forget to add fries inside the wrap for no additional charge.  The lines can get pretty long around noon on workdays, but the staff is capable and efficient."
1306,Greek Kitchen,I know this place has gotten some mixed reviews but we've always had great food and perfect service. Their hummus is CRAZY GOOD!
1307,Greek Kitchen,"Salad, kebab, gyro!  All very fresh and very good."
1308,Greek Kitchen,"Greek food in Chipotle style. Fast casual dining. Good food, good taste, fast. Great for lunch. Lines can be crazy long at noon. Come early."
1309,Greek Kitchen,Their soup is great
1310,Greek Kitchen,"Great food. Excellent prices. Plenty of space to grab a table and have lunch with friends/colleagues. Maybe skip the falafel though, as it's a little dry. Gyros are where it's at."
1311,Greek Kitchen,"Great food! Affordable, simple menu with a lot of selections."
1312,Greek Kitchen,A hidden gem in the midst of the hustle and bustle.
1313,Greek Kitchen,Always very good
1314,Greek Kitchen,I really love the Greek salad here with lamb and beef meat. The pitas that come with the meals are warm and soft.
1315,Greek Kitchen,They also have a rewards punch card that makes the 11th meal free.
1316,Greek Kitchen,This place is really good. Good fries good meat. Love the Gyros!
1317,Greek Kitchen,Delicious cafeteria style Greek food. Good variety to make your own plate.
1318,Greek Kitchen,I have to limit myself visiting here because the food's just that addictive. The greek fries alone are 5 stars.
1319,Greek Kitchen,"Te food was good, service was good. Environment was clean & sanitary."
1320,Greek Kitchen,"GRK Greek Kitchen is like the assembly-line Chipotle-esque experience for Greek food. It's good if you want to mix up your typical lunch routine downtown, but slightly overpriced and nothing extraordinary. The lamb gyro meat is juicy and tender, but the chicken can be dry. The hummus is not flavorful or thick enough for my liking. Their homemade rice pudding is tasty though."
1321,Greek Kitchen,"Fist time but it won't be my last. Price is good, food is great and I'm satisfied."
1322,Greek Kitchen,"Omg this place is super awesome. it's perfect for lunch, and its super clean and has great food. We tried the gyros platter and the chicken kebob platter. Both are delicious, I loved the tzatziki sauce and the orzo pasta. The hummus was rather a let down, but they have a killer orangini drink that comes in a cool bottle that I like. Im going to use the bottle to make a vase for flowers."
1323,Greek Kitchen,"The place doesn't have a great ambience, but it has high cielings, is super clean, and the staff is helpful. They even made us fresh falafels which were super delish."
1324,Greek Kitchen,The 2 platters were $20 and fed three people. Reason enough for me to come back. See you soon Med Kitchen~
1325,Greek Kitchen,Fast and I received fresh food which is always a good thing.
1326,Greek Kitchen,"Healthiest fast food option in the loop............and equally delicious. All they need is homemade bread, saganaki and ouzo.....just sayin."
1327,Greek Kitchen,"Good, fast, inexpensive Greek food in the loop. I love this fast casual take on Greek food!"
1328,Greek Kitchen,"Fast, inexpensive and delicious. The staff can be irritable at times because of a language barrier and a loud atmosphere but can you really blame them?"
1329,Greek Kitchen,Food is good and the staff is friendly.
1330,Greek Kitchen,"One of the few places where the falafel actually has taste.  Great option of sauces always does it for me.  $7.99 for a 4 big pieces of falafel, fresh pita, hummos and salad is a great deal."
1331,Greek Kitchen,Good DIY greek food- not the best i've ever had but provides variety compared to Naf naf and Roti
1332,Greek Kitchen,The food here is very good like how you can get whatever toppings you want on your gyro without an extra charge. Its put you in the mind of a greek chipotle. The greek fries are very good and tasty too. They also have a nice selection of greek choices to choose from.
1333,Greek Kitchen,"Similar concept to many other restaurants in the loop. You decide between a handheld, bowl, or plate. I chose to try the gyros on a white pita. As my toppings I added tzatziki, feta, cucumbers, tomatoes, and kalamata olives. Overall, it was decent. The meat seemed pretty lacking in flavor but the toppings made up for it. The second dish I tried was the falafel on a white pita. As my toppings I added hummus, tahini, cucumbers, and tomatoes. Unfortunately the falafel was completely flavorless and very Americanized. I would still go back to try their other protein options or if I was really craving a gyros."
1334,Greek Kitchen,Spinach salad was delish!
1335,Greek Kitchen,"Wow, here is so amazing, it's like having Greek style Chipotle, the food is amazing."
1336,Greek Kitchen,Good fast casual Greek food.
1337,Greek Kitchen,Love this place.
1338,Greek Kitchen,Plate is small but delicious.
1339,Greek Kitchen,The food is grate !  Definitely a must try !
1340,Greek Kitchen,"Fast, inexpensive, and easy."
1341,Greek Kitchen,Love the food very fresh and healthy
1342,Greek Kitchen,Delicious food
1343,Greek Kitchen,"Great place, a little pricy though."
1344,Greek Kitchen,Greek inspired bar and grill with rooftop lounge.
1345,Greek Kitchen,Good food
1346,Greek Kitchen,Gyros is so delicious and refreshing to eat
1347,Greek Kitchen,was looking for a gyro downtown near work
1348,Greek Kitchen,Tasty and fresh.
1349,Greek Kitchen,No complaints.
1350,Greek Kitchen,Wow.....excellent
1351,Indian Garden Restaurant,"This is a 4 star, vegetarian-, vegan-, and Halal-friendly place specialized in Indian food with spicy options."
1352,Indian Garden Restaurant,"My first Indian restaurant. The food was amazing! The lamb curry üôèüôè was perfect. Wide selection of food, but not overwhelming. The waiter was very patient with us and understanding that we didn't know Indian food that well. The manager, Abhinav, was amazingly polite and professional. I've been to places where you have to wait so long for the waiter or bus boy to check on you, or refill drinks. NOT HERE. We always had a full water pitcher and were constantly asking if we needed refills. The restaurant itself was beautifully decorated. The background music was great. A very peaceful and welcoming vibe. Will definitely be returning and recommending to all my friends and family and to everyone reading this. And they also make a great martini!!"
1353,Indian Garden Restaurant,"Ordered tandoori dinner special, felt it was pricey initially but it was worth the money.  Execellent kebabs. Shrimp kebab was exceptional. It also came with mutton rogan josh and paneer curry. Mutton was tender and gravy was really good. Over all enjoyed every bite of the dinner."

1356,Indian Garden Restaurant,"A good authentic restaurant with decent inside decor.
Express lunch options are great and not very pricey despite it is being in downtown. One can definitely give a try for sure."
1357,Indian Garden Restaurant,I simply have so explanation for why this restaurant only has 4*! I love love love Indian food and have tested plenty of restaurants. I ordered here for the first time yesterday and had to order again tonight. It‚Äôs amazing! Fresh! Authentic! I will order here over and over again!!! Thank you!
1358,Indian Garden Restaurant,"Ordered tandoori dinner special, felt it was pricey initially but it was worth the money.  Execellent kebabs. Shrimp kebab was exceptional. It also came with mutton rogan josh and paneer curry. Mutton was tender and gravy was really good. Over all enjoyed every bite of the dinner."
1359,Indian Garden Restaurant,Very elegant and accessible place. They serve large portions and for affordable rates. We loved the menu very much and the staff members were very attentive and explanatory. Recommended.
1360,Indian Garden Restaurant,"My first Indian restaurant. The food was amazing! The lamb curry üôèüôè was perfect. Wide selection of food, but not overwhelming. The waiter was very patient with us and understanding that we didn't know Indian food that well. The manager, Abhinav, was amazingly polite and professional. I've been to places where you have to wait so long for the waiter or bus boy to check on you, or refill drinks. NOT HERE. We always had a full water pitcher and were constantly asking if we needed refills. The restaurant itself was beautifully decorated. The background music was great. A very peaceful and welcoming vibe. Will definitely be returning and recommending to all my friends and family and to everyone reading this. And they also make a great martini!!"
1361,Indian Garden Restaurant,"Indian Garden is one of my favorite restaurants. The food is excellent and the service is great. I recently took a friend there for his birthday and he loved it, which pleased my heart!!"
1362,Indian Garden Restaurant,"Nice dinner setting, with huge portions."
1363,Indian Garden Restaurant,"Called for an early dinner, a large clientele of Indian/Asian customers (a good sign for me!)"
1364,Indian Garden Restaurant,"Not cheap but massive portions, two starters was too much and would have been better sharing one. Poppadoms were given on arrival with a tamarind and a mint sauce both delicious. Main courses were well seasoned and tasty and the pea pilau rice very well cooked."
1365,Indian Garden Restaurant,I would recommend and go back again.
1366,Indian Garden Restaurant,"We ordered Butter Chicken, Punjabi Samosa, Gosht Rogan Josh and Chicken Biryani and the food was just heavenly!! Me and my family had a great time :) The decor was beautiful and staff was very friendly and helpful. I would highly recommend anyone looking for a great Indian spot in the heart of Chicago. Must Visit!!   Although the buffet is temporarily suspended the options remain plentiful. Staff is friendly and welcoming and I would recommend this place to anyone in the area. We all need to help out our local establishments so get out there and dine safely!"
1367,Indian Garden Restaurant,The perfect food of Indian cuisine... I really loved... The manager is so kind and all the time was interesting if everything is good. I highly recommend this place‚Ä¶
1368,Indian Garden Restaurant,A good authentic restaurant with decent inside decor. Express lunch options are great and not very pricey despite it is being in downtown. One can definitely give a try for sure.
1369,Indian Garden Restaurant,"Overall fantastic food. Loved the Tikka masala, bhindi masala, naan (garlic was the best), aloo gobi, and biryani. Only issue is the place is a bit pricy"
1370,Indian Garden Restaurant,"One of the best Indian food in Chicago. The interiors are ornate, inviting and add a lot to the ambience. There are a lot of Curry and Tandoor options to choose from. They also have a separate section for lamb entrees. Menu covers a lot of North Indian fare which is typical of any Indian restaurant in the US. Service was on the slow side and is definitely an area of improvement. We had to wait 30+ minutes for the food and the server never showed up after bringing the order to the table to check if we wanted to order more. Having said that, the food here wins everything so 5 stars."
1371,Indian Garden Restaurant,"Lamb samosas were spot on, with a perfectly spicy herb and parsley sauce. Garlic naan was fluffy and crispy, and the curry was spectacular. Probably way more than the two of us ever needed for lunch, thank goodness for to go containers (and an extra order of the garlic naan to be safe!)"
1372,Indian Garden Restaurant,Great Indian spot. Try the vindaloo it has some great flavor and spice level. Lovely atmosphere and great lighting. I always appreciate good lighting. Definitely worth stopping in to eat.
1373,Indian Garden Restaurant,Delicious and a wide variety of dishes.  Pickups are always ready on time.   Love this place.
1374,Indian Garden Restaurant,I like to go with friends to this restaurant with my highest recommendations. I visit this place often. I get very good feedback from my friends. The the cooking is great and the team is generous and cooperative. Every time  we visit this place we pass a pleasing evening.  I recommend this place with pleasure.
1375,Indian Garden Restaurant,Filled me up. I'll return friends next time. The bill was average for the menu. Reminds me of a place in New York I liked to visit.
1376,Indian Garden Restaurant,"Fast, efficient, and courteous service. Prices were decent. Menu is similar to a restaurant in El Paso I loved."
1377,Indian Garden Restaurant,"Delicious food, great service every time and the decor and atmosphere of the restaurant is so charming and warm. This place is a forever favorite. They‚Äôre lunch buffet is amazing as well!"
1378,Indian Garden Restaurant,"Update: still love this place but we‚Äôve been coming here for about two years and there‚Äôs not an ounce of recognition or familiarity on any of the workers or owners face. Never hear a ‚Äúcome again, or nice to see you guys back‚Äù. Never. Nothing. It‚Äôs like the first time every time. Which at first didn‚Äôt bother me but now it has really started to. Food is still good. Deducting a star for this weird/awkward and impersonal service."
1379,Indian Garden Restaurant,"One of the most beautiful Indian restaurants I have seen. The food is fresh and delicious! We had a chicken tikka masala, saag paneer, chicken biryani and garlic naans! For appetizers I had the aloo (veggie) samosas. All in all, ambiance, food and customer service is one of a kind! Great experience in Chicago! The owner/manager seems very caring about his customers too."
1380,Indian Garden Restaurant,"Excellent spot to buy some food when in a rush. The service is rapid, prices are convenient, good atmosphere. Highly recommended"
1381,Indian Garden Restaurant,"Had veg pakoras which were served with two different chutneys. These pakoras were really good. Also ordered Qeema Naam that was a bit light on the meat content and high on meaty aroma. Also yoghurt in the raita that I ordered was quite sour! It was also a bit overpriced, however the higher prices are justified given the extremely convenient location off Michigan Ave. Overall, enjoyed the experience, but wasn't something to which I will want to return."
1382,Indian Garden Restaurant,"Went for the buffet and was impressed by the spread. Good selection of curries (the chole were to die for), appetizers not that much. Lovely ambience."
1383,Indian Garden Restaurant,"My favorite Indian restaurant in Chicago! I happened upon this gem during a conference +15 years ago, and I'm so glad I did! Consistently delicious food and a warm friendly environment. I love Indian Garden and dine there whenever I'm in the area."
1384,Indian Garden Restaurant,"Went here for dinner and with a group of 8 after setting up for an event. Very good food and great atmosphere! Really enjoyed our time here and the staff was super friendly, which made our time even better after a long day of organization. As a local, I can't wait to come back and try other things on the menu!"
1385,Indian Garden Restaurant,"Hands down best Indian food around. Paneer is always fresh, great service. Must try when in Chicago!"
1386,Indian Garden Restaurant,Beautiful place and good selection of food.
1387,Indian Garden Restaurant,Excellent food (zabiha halal) great ambiance and customer service!

1390,Indian Garden Restaurant,Super friendly manager was great with the kids. The buffet is excellent with a good combination of meat/vegetarian dishes as well as spicy/non-spicy options.   We will be back.
1391,Indian Garden Restaurant,Really great place and delicious food! Went few times and enjoyed it!
1392,Indian Garden Restaurant,We went for a lunch buffet. The food was great. There were wide range of veg and non veg options. Naan and roti were super soft and best naan i had in US.Desserts were equally good. we went a little late almost before closing time but the staff were very accommodative. The service was great. The price might seem a little high but is totally worth considering the taste and variety of options.
1393,Indian Garden Restaurant,Do yourself a favor and try this place. The service was sociable and attentive. Bring your hunger - portions are filling.
1394,Indian Garden Restaurant,"Liked the ambiance. Food was tasty. Buffet was a break from regular dishes like Saag Paneer, Cabbage side dish and Daal. They had broccoli masala, squash curry, dahi vada. Desserts were so yumm."
1395,Indian Garden Restaurant,The service was very sociable and kind. The prices are well within reason for the quality.
1396,Indian Garden Restaurant,Great place especially their buffet selection is quite filling and yummy. Recommended!
1397,Indian Garden Restaurant,authentic and delicious indian food. large portions and wonderful staff.
1398,Indian Garden Restaurant,We enjoy to go out. Last night we went to this superb place which we didn‚Äôt know before. We enjoyed a beautiful time there with superb cooking and a nice stuff and a distinguished cook. We put this place in our phone list  and we will definitely go again very soon.  Highly recommended.
1399,Indian Garden Restaurant,"Food is delicious and portions are huge! For Indian food in the downtown area, I think this place has the best value. I've been there a few times too before quarantine and the ambiance is nice. Hopefully it can reopen and be like pre-quarantine."
1400,Indian Garden Restaurant,"Couldn't ask for more from a restaurant! We were attended to promptly upon arriving, and frequently during the meal. The chicken masala and aloo gobi complemented each other perfectly. Great ambiance as well!"
1401,Indian Garden Restaurant,"Loved the restaurant! First of all the ambiance was great and the decor is pretty nice looking as well. Great options in terms is food for vegetarians as well. Food was really good. Especially the Naan, which was so soft and yummy! Service was great too! Overall a great place for a date or a family dinner."
1402,Indian Garden Restaurant,The place is good for Indian food. Ordered hyderabadi chicken gravy and Chicken masala gravy. The taste was good and it was delicious. The ambience is amazing. The portion can be little larger. The service is good. The dessert option is limited. Its not pricey too.
1403,Indian Garden Restaurant,Very well kept and convenient place. They provide generous meals and for fair prices. I liked the menu very much and the staff members were super attentive and explanatory. Will definitely recommend this spot.
1404,Indian Garden Restaurant,The place serves large portions and for affordable prices. very friendly staff members. 5 stars.
1405,Indian Garden Restaurant,"The food was good and authentic. Baigan bharta was very India like. Dal tadka was ""different"" since it was made using masoor dal! (Wasn't toor or chana for sure). Ambience is very good and the service was excellent. Probably the best in downtown area. It's located on the second floor so your might miss it from the road. Just remember it is next to Aloft."
1406,Indian Garden Restaurant,"Indian Garden Restaurant serves authentic Indian food. The food is not very spicy but at the same time it resembles very close taste to the food on motherland. This being said,  you can definitely take friends and family with low spice tolerance without second thoughts :) I went to this place with a friend and tried their Punjabi Thali for dinner and the food was sufficient for the two of us, except we ordered some extra daal tadka, and an extra Rasgulla would have made the meal nicer. The restaurant is located in downtown Chicago and has beautiful ambience and good service. Also, it is a bit on the expensive side but it is still definitely recommended."
1407,Indian Garden Restaurant,A small piece of advice - The restaurant is located on second floor and it is usually confusing on reaching there to find it. Just keep climbing the stairs and you should be fine!!
1408,Indian Garden Restaurant,"Well prepared and delicious Indian food (I ate vegetarian food). Food serving proportions are quite generous. Taste is quite authentically Indian. Very conveniently located in downtown Chicago, close to a large number of 5 star Hotels, which may not serve any Indian food at all. Hence a very good option for lunch and dinner - for the Indian tourist looking for desi food."
1409,Indian Garden Restaurant,"There is plenty of Indian restaurants to choose from and this was nearby our hotel. Seen reviews and decided to check it out. 2nd floor restaurant and you notice the decor and it was busy. I've seen alot of Indian folks over us who are not from that culture and figure it had to be good. My wife and I order chicken biryani and it definitely was alot of food actually we could've shared a dish. The flavors was perfect and it was so delicious like real authentic and not commercialized or microwaved food. I was impressed and glad I chose that location I would definitely recommend and I will certainly go back, that's how good it was for us."
1410,Indian Garden Restaurant,Tasty food and beautiful decorations. Thanks!
1411,Indian Garden Restaurant,"Had dinner here with a group of friends and the food is amazing! We ordered both meatless, chicken, and I believe lamb dishes - all were great. And the ambiance is very nice as well. This is a great place for friends or a cute date night. try it, you won't be disappointed."
1412,Indian Garden Restaurant,"My hunt for authentic cuisine is official over. Indian Garden is a place I can see myself come back time after time again. I came here on two separate occasions, once for dinner and another for lunch. I must say the quality of the selection really blew me away. I personally recommend the lunch buffet with a solid lineup of paneer, different curries (meat and vegetarian), and chicken prepared tandoori and malai style, served with fresh naan, which is always served hot and soft. To finish things off, they've got my favorite indian desserts: gulab jamun (spongy milk balls)and kheer (Indian rice pudding). The interior is well decorated and the service is always on point. The management is clearly top notch here!"
1413,Indian Garden Restaurant,"This place smell good from the moment you step in, the menu is hard to keep open and the server wanted us to order quickly, the chicken tiky was ok, the atmosphere is awesome, the music is awesome, the decorations are beautiful and authentic, nice resta"

1415,Indian Garden Restaurant,This spot is worth visiting. They serve large portions for affordable rates. Consistently well organized and with fantastic ambience. Will come back again.
1416,Indian Garden Restaurant,Awesome place. Must go if you like Indian food. They served One of the best Indian food I had in US. The staff was humble too and gave good suggestions. Specially liked the paneer preparations. Deserts were not that great.
1417,Indian Garden Restaurant,"Good taste. Nice ambient, decorated like a typical Indian museum.."
1418,Indian Garden Restaurant,Amazing place! Great food! Awesome ambiance!
1419,Indian Garden Restaurant,"We came to this spot for lunch. This restaurant was recommended to us by a friend.  Well, we were not disappointed. The crew were extremely nice and we felt excellent. The food was just great. We had a great time and we will definitely return to this restaurant. Keep it up."
1420,Indian Garden Restaurant,"I celebrated my PhD last night in this excellent restaurant. I am glad to say that we passed a cool evening and the restaurant was unquestionably one of the reasons for this successful meeting. The crew  helped in a pleasant style, the food was tasty and my friends were extremely  delighted. We shall definitely come back again for more events. thanks very much."
1421,Indian Garden Restaurant,I have found really tasty Indian food here. A lot of vegetarian options in menu. I will strictly recommend this place.
1422,Indian Garden Restaurant,This place was open on Christmas day so it was pretty pack even till about closing. It was located upstairs and beautifully decorated. It took us a little while for our order to be taken but otherwise the service was amazing and the food was really delicious.
1423,Indian Garden Restaurant,This spot is the one I always prefer. I go to many restaurants but to this place I  constantly return again and again. The crew is very amicable and the food they offer is so good. I never decline to have a good dinner in this restaurant. I highly recommend this place.
1424,Indian Garden Restaurant,"Greatest Indian place in downtown Chicago. Worth visiting even only for the ambience. The food matches it perfectly and then goes beyond. Well balanced, delicious, fresh. Our typical test based on a dal soup and bhindi masala passed with A+. The okra was so fresh and tender it was frightening :-) The chai could motivate itself to become spicier. No Jaan at the bar but has that ever stopped you!? :-) Stepping into the restaurant transfers you in a different world - one worth the experience. The retro poster in the bathroom and the European wall paper are wormholes for different dimensions‚Ä¶"
1425,Indian Garden Restaurant,"This restaurant was absolutely amazing. I came here from New York this past weekend with my family and it is by far the best Indian food I have ever had. I really enjoyed the way the place was decorated and how friendly the staff was. It was also very kid friendly and I went with my little cousins, which was great! I would definitely recommend going here if you want fair priced authentic Indian food with a great view. 10/10"
1426,Indian Garden Restaurant,"This restaurant is awesome and broad, the menu was enchanting and the prices were very economical. quick, productive service and very welcoming staff members. Highly recommended."
1427,Indian Garden Restaurant,"Everything in the buffet is always high quality, has great flavor and a good amount of heat. I would probably just not recommend the Indian Garden buffet to anyone who doesn't like their food a little spicy, but it honestly might be the best Indian buffet I've had yet. Also, can now confirm their normal menu entrees are extremely good. Have never eaten anything here that wasn't delicious and I'm admittedly not the easiest to please."
1428,Indian Garden Restaurant,The food is excellent very tasty and the service is perfect I love this restaurant.
1429,Indian Garden Restaurant,"One of the best Indian restaurants in Chicago. Must go. But beware of the long queues, side effect of the best food you get there. Better to have reservation done beforehand."
1430,Indian Garden Restaurant,"Real authentic Indian food, no cheesy Bollywood decor"
1431,Indian Garden Restaurant,"Tastefully decorated, the restaurant immediately feels authentic when you step inside. We were given a fried lentil chip with mint and tamarind (?) sauce as a starter while we perused their extensive menu. We enjoyed our light platter and house special dinners immensely, and took home enough for lunch tomorrow. Manager was friendly and engaging and took time to chat with us after our meal."
1432,Indian Garden Restaurant,I like this restaurant very much. Visiting almost always when in Chicago. Great food but service can be better. When I pay 18.90 for buffet (with tax) I expect to have naan in 5 minutes not 15.
1433,Indian Garden Restaurant,"After trying 5-6 Indian restaurants in Chicago downtown, I would rate it the best in surrounding. This is bit expensive but has variety of Indian dishes with amazing ambience. Good for family dinner or dinner with office colleagues."
1434,Indian Garden Restaurant,Great food. Friendly attentive service.
1435,Indian Garden Restaurant,Great weekday lunch buffet with quick service.  They serve a wide variety of vegetarian as well as animal protein options on the buffet.  I always try something new.  Consistently good food!
1436,Indian Garden Restaurant,Excellent lunch buffet at a reasonable price. Large selection of vegetarian and non-vegetarian meals. Dinner menu is pretty exhaustive as well. Very friendly staff and usually no wait time / no reservations needed. Location is great!

1440,Indian Garden Restaurant,The service was very sociable and kind.
1441,Indian Garden Restaurant,The ambience was nice. I went for a lunch buffet and they had wide variety in the buffet menu. Everything was delicious. The mutton curry was a little spicy though but I liked it.
1442,Indian Garden Restaurant,"Visited this place back again after 4 years or might be more but it is exactly the same; which is the reason why I choose to go there; Best food, Best customer service and really friendly and understanding staff; i never felt like half stomach after eating here because there food is so comfortable to stomach you can just eat up.

1444,Indian Garden Restaurant,I eat here a lot since I work close by. I like how the customer service is always excellent and they keep the spot well kept consistently. Pricing is affordable and they serve large portions.
1445,Indian Garden Restaurant,Nice ambience. We were here on Sunday for lunch. They only offered buffet that day and it was fine.
